Hello, it's me I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet To go over everything They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be When we were younger and free I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us And a million miles Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside At least, I can say that I've tried To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you? It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened? It's no secret that the both of us Are running out of time So hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside At least, I can say that I've tried To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Anymore Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside At least, I can say that I've tried To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore I heard that you're settled down That you found a girl and you're married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy? Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too "Don't forget me," I beg "I'll remember," you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too "Don't forget me," I beg "I'll remember," you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Nothing compares, no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you "Don't forget me," I beg "I'll remember," you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too "Don't forget me," I beg "I'll remember," you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead I will leave my heart at the door I won't say a word They've all been said before, you know So why don't we just play pretend Like we're not scared of what is coming next Or scared of having nothing left? Look, don't get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do What lovers do It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty It's already in your eyes And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me No one knows me like you do And since you're the only one that mattered Tell me, who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do What lovers do It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love Let this be the way we remember us I don't want to be cruel or vicious And I ain't asking for forgiveness All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do What lovers do It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? Everybody loves the things you do From the way you talk to the way you move Everybody here is watching you Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true But if by chance you're here alone Can I have a moment before I go?

Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place? Should I leave it there? Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? I build myself up and fly around in circles Waiting as my heart drops And my back begins to tingle Finally, could this be it, or? Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place? Should I leave it there? Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place? Should I leave it there? Should I give up, or should I just keep on chasing pavements? Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Oh, oh Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place? Should I leave it there? Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? I only wanted to have fun Learning to fly, learning to run I let my heart decide the way When I was young Deep down, I must have always known That this would be inevitable To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay And bare my soul I know I'm not the only one Who regrets the things they've done Sometimes, I just feel it's only me Who can't stand the reflection that they see I wish I could live a little more Look up to the sky, not just the floor I feel like my life is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry I miss the air, I miss my friends I miss my mother, I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets Where I grew up and found my feet They can't look me in the eye It's like they're scared of me I try to think of things to say Like a joke or a memory But they don't recognize me now In the light of day I know I'm not the only one Who regrets the things they've done Sometimes, I just feel it's only me Who never became who they thought they'd be I wish I could live a little more Look up to the sky, not just the floor I feel like my life is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry I miss the air, I miss my friends I miss my mother, I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown But that was a million years ago A million years ago This is the end Hold your breath and count to ten Feel the Earth move, and then Hear my heart burst again For this is the end I've drowned and dreamt this moment So overdue, I owe them Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together At Skyfall At Skyfall Skyfall is where we start A thousand miles and poles apart Where worlds collide and days are dark You may have my number You can take my name But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together At Skyfall Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Where you go I go What you see I see I know I'd never be me Without the security Of your loving arms Keeping me from harm Put your hand in my hand And we'll stand Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together At Skyfall Let the sky fall We will stand tall At Skyfall I want every single piece of you I want your heaven and your oceans too Treat me soft but touch me cruel I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby Bring the floor up to my knees Let me fall into your gravity Then kiss me back to life to see Your body standing over me Baby, don't let the lights go down Baby, don't let the lights go down Baby, don't let the lights go down Lights go down, lights go down Lights go down, lights go down Down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out It illuminates all of my doubts Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go Baby, give me light I miss you when the lights go out It illuminates all of my doubts Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go Baby, give me light I love the way your body moves Towards me from across the room Brushing past my every groove No one has me like you do, baby Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul But be delicate with my ego I wanna step into your great unknown With you and me setting the tone Baby, don't let the lights go down Baby, don't let the lights go down Baby, don't let the lights go down Lights go down, lights go down Lights go down, lights go down Down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out It illuminates all of my doubts Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go Baby, give me light I miss you when the lights go out It illuminates all of my doubts Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go Baby, give me light We play so dirty in the dark Cause we are living worlds apart It only makes it harder, baby It only makes it harder, baby Harder baby, harder baby I miss you when the lights go out It illuminates all of my doubts Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go Baby, give me light I miss you when the lights go out It illuminates all of my doubts Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go Baby, give me light I miss you, I miss you I miss you, I miss you I miss you, I miss you I miss you, I miss you When the rain is blowing in your face And the whole world is on your case I could offer you a warm embrace To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear And there is no one there to dry your tears I could hold you for a million years To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet But I would never do you wrong I've known it from the moment that we met No doubt in my mind where you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue I'd go crawling down the avenue No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rollin' sea And on the highway of regret The winds of change are blowing wild and free You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true Nothing that I wouldn't do Go to the ends of the earth for you To make you feel my love To make you feel my love Take your eyes off me so I can leave I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me This is never ending, we have been here before But I can't stay this time cause I don't love you anymore Please stay where you are, don't come any closer Don't try to change my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark It feels like we're oceans apart There is so much space between us Baby, we're already defeated Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight Please don't fall apart, I can't face your breaking heart I'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark It feels like we're oceans apart There is so much space between us Baby, we're already defeated Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me We're not the only ones I don't regret a thing Every word I've said You know I'll always mean It is the world to me That you are in my life But I want to live and not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark It feels like we're oceans apart There is so much space between us Baby, we're already defeated Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe Right before my eyes I saw my heart, it came to life This ain't easy, it's not meant to be, every story has its scars But when the pain cuts you deep When the night keeps you from sleeping Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy When the world seems so cruel And your heart makes you feel like a fool I promise you will see that I will
