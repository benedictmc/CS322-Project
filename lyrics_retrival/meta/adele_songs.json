ooh\n\nLooking for some affirmation\nMade my way into the sun\nMy friends got their ladies\nAnd they're all having babies\nI just wanna have some fun\n\nI won't bore you with the details, baby\nI don't even wanna waste your time\nLet's just say that maybe\nYou could help me ease my mind\nI ain't Mr. Right\n\nBut if you're looking for fast love\nIf that's love in your eyes\nIt's more than enough\nI've had some bad love\nSo fast love is all that I've got on my mind\n\nOoh, ooh\nBaby, baby\nOoh, ooh\nBaby, baby\nOoh, ooh\nBaby, baby\nOoh\n\nIn the absence of security\nI made my way into the night\nStupid cupid keeps on calling me\nAnd I see nothing in his eyes\nI miss my baby\nOh I, I miss my baby\nI miss my baby\nI miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby\nOoh I, I miss my baby\n\n",

that we know that it hurts\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery now and then my memories ache\nWith the empty ideas of the ones we'd have made\nBut as time goes on and my age gets older\nI love the ones I know,

heart\nAnd it cries like a child whenever we're apart\nI've seen your face under every sky\nI find the less I look, the more I find\n\n[Chorus]\nSo let's go back there, back to the start\nI swear I'm never gonna leave you\nYou're the only one I want\nLet's go back there, back to the start\nYou know I'm never gonna leave you\nCause you're the only one I want\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark\nBut, I'm fearless and brave when I'm in the arms\nYou said my name in the dead of glory\nYou hold me upright\nWhen I'm short of falling\n\n[Chorus]\nSo let's go back there, back to the start\nI swear I'm never gonna leave you\nCause you're the only one I want\nLet's go back there, back to the start\nI swear I'm never gonna leave you\nCause you're the only one I want\n\n[Bridge]\nThere will be times\nWhen we'll try and give it up\nBursting at the seams\nNo doubt that we'll almost fall apart\nThen burn to pieces\nAnd we'll watch them turn to dust\nBut, without each other, nothing else is enough\n\n[Chorus]\nSo let's go back there, back to the start\nI swear I'm never gonna leave you\nCause you're the only one I want\nLet's go back there, back to the start\nI swear I'm never gonna leave you\nCause you're the only one I want\n\n[Outro]\nYou're the only one\nNever gonna leave you\nNo, I'm never gonna leave you, no\n\n",

very much. Thank you. First of all, I really do apologize for swearing. I just... this means... George Michael, I love him, it means a lot to me, so I'm really sorry if I offended anyone anywhere\n\nEveryone, this is Greg Kurstin. Give it up for Greg Kurstin. Thank you very much for this award. Thank you to the Academy, thank you to my record labels XL and Sony, thank you to my manager, Jonathan. I always get so nervous... And I'd like to thank Greg, because Greg kept coming to England for me, to work with me. And I was really hard work this record, had a very short attention span, and he would come to me in England so that I didn't have to leave my son, and yet you would leave your son and daughter. So thank you for your patience with me and for helping to create my favorite song I've ever done. So thank you, Greg\n\n[Greg Kurstin]\n...Thank you to my mom and dad...\n\n", "https://genius.com/Adele-black-and-gold-lyrics": "\n\nIf fish swam out of the ocean and grew legs and they
