he's got a driving ban\nAmongst some other offences\nAnd I've seen him with girls of the night\nAnd he told Roxanne to put on her red light\nThey're all infected but he'll be alright\nCause he's a scumbag, don't you know\nI said he's a scumbag, don't you know!\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlthough you're trying not to listen\nI bet your eyes are staring at the ground\nShe makes a subtle proposition\nI'm sorry love I'll have to turn you down\nAnd oh he must be up to something\nWant half a chance to show he's more than likely\nI've got a feeling in my stomach\nI start to wonder what his story might be\nWhat his story might be\n\n[Chorus]\nThey said it changes when the sun goes down\nThey said it changes when the sun goes down\nThey said it changes when the sun goes down\nAround here\nAround\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd look here comes a Ford Mondeo\nIsn't he Mister Inconspicuous\nAnd he don't have to say 'owt\nShe's in the stance ready to get picked up\nAnd she's delighted when she sees him\nPulling in and giving her the eye\nBecause she must be fucking freezing\nScantily clad beneath the clear night sky\nShe don't stop in the winter, no and...\n\n[Chorus]\nThey said it changes when the sun goes down\nThey said it changes when the sun goes down\nThey said it changes when the sun goes down\nAround here\nThey said it changes when the sun goes down\nThey said it changes when the sun goes down\nThey said it changes when the sun goes down\nAround here\nAround here\n\n[Outro]\nWhat a scummy man\nJust give him half a chance\nI bet he'll rob you if he can\nCan see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan\nI hope you're not involved at all\n\n", "https://genius.com/Arctic-monkeys-katy-on-a-mission-lyrics": "\n\nIn this room of darkness, I ain't undercover\nBut that won't stop my
