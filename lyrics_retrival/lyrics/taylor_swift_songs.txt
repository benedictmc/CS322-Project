[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me—)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

 

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose
I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (what they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
You hold me down, and I protect you with my life

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don’t wanna see
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

 

[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
In the middle of the night

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

 

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge: Taylor Swift + Kendrick Lamar]
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

 

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

 

[Verse 1]
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Outro]
(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want… to

 

[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?

 

[Verse 1]
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (mm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (mm, yeah)
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl
He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you, and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"

[Chorus]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
(A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go)
We never go out of style

[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh
(Out of style)

[Chorus]
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (and when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

 

[Intro]
Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Alone
Unless you wanna come along

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous

 

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin', pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes (Echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh!)

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no!)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it...)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

[Outro]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

 

[Verse 1]
I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad(oh)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Verse 2]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad(oh)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
It just felt so good

[Bridge]
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
So light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (Light me up)
Light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)
Light me up (Light me up), light me up

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Outro]
Oh, you say I did something bad
(You say I did something bad?)
Why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)
It just felt so good, good

 

[Verse 1]
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about—

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha...

[Post-Chorus]
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best of me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops...
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don’t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Outro]
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

 

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

 

[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin’, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin’
And I was just drinkin’
Well, he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, "Go, go, go!"
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We’re both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Outro]
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

 

[Verse 1]
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "Baby" like tryin' on clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

[Verse 2]
Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

[Bridge]
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

 

[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus]
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard, or it’s wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3]
There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Outro]
Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)

 

[Verse 1]
See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

[Bridge]
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting?
(1, 2, 3)

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall (Pieces fall)
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep (Oh)
And I'm yours to lose (Baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
I do bad things with you
So it goes…

[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

 

[Verse 1]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

[Bridge]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(He didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

 

[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah haa (ah-aah haa)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah haa

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday when you leave me, I'd bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning (burning) it (it) down (down)
Someday when you leave me, I'll bet these memories
Follow (follow) you (you) around (around)
(Follow you around)

[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha (ah-aah-aah-aah-aah-ha)
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha

 

[Verse 1]
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

[Verse 2]
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance?
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
(Again!)

[Chorus]
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing (oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing)

 

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "please don't go," and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: "Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'"

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Because we were both young when I first saw you

[Verse 1]
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mm, mm
That's what people say, mm, mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mm, mm
That's what people say, mm, mm

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off,  I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 2]
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don’t see, mm, mm
That's what they don’t see, mm, mm
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mm, mm
That’s what they don’t know, mm, mm

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off,  I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Post-Chorus]
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down
To this sick beat

[Bridge]
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, “Oh my God,” but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
(Haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off,  I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmhm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
(And fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Post-Chorus]
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (yeah)
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you got to)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

 

[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst (oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
There was nothing left to do (oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

[Breakdown]
The drought was the very worst (oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
(Oh)

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

[Outro]
(Oh, oh)
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'm finally clean

 

[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
When the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said, "I'm setting you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
(Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
(Are we?)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good

 

[Intro]
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

[Verse 1]
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past, thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus 2]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus 3]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

 

[Verse 1]
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, you can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing (yeah) to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So, cool, come along with me
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
The best people in life are free
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Please take my hand, and
Please take me dancing, and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Breakdown]
Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle, oh-oh
But every night with us is like a dream

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

 

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(You were right there)
So, shame on me now (you were right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Outro]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Outro]

 

[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

 

[Verse 1]
Flashing lights, and we
Took a wrong turn, and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' 'round me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland

[Verse 2]
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there was strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' 'round me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
Whoa, in Wonderland

[Bridge]
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad
Oh

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Last forever (ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better
Never better (ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
And we pretended it could last forever (in Wonderland)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
And life was never worse but never better
In Wonderland

 

[Verse 1]
One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, "Look up"
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Verse 2]
Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says "You're my best friend"
And you knew what it was, he is in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love

[Breakdown]
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

[Breakdown]
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

 

[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22, 22

[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh
(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright (ooh) if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (alright)
We just keep dancing like we're 22 (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
22 (I don't know about you)
22, 22

[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if (ooh) you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22 (whoa, oh)
22 (dancing like)
22 (yeah, yeah), 22, (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

 

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
(You good to go?)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran + Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Bridge: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like i've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look lIke coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

 

[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

[Chorus]
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!) Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was stay

[Verse 2]
Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

[Chorus]
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!) Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (stay! stay! stay! stay! stay!)

[Bridge]
Let me remind you
This was what you wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was

[Chorus]
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!) Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!) Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
(All you had to do was stay)
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (stay!) (Oh)
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (stay!) (Ooh)
All you had to do was (stay!)

 

[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed "space" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ever) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, "Never say never"
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, "I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Outro]
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh, yeah)
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

 

[Verse 1]
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on
And I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

[Chorus 1]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

[Chorus 2]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
And this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)

[Bridge]
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

[Chorus 2]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love)
This love left a permanent mark
(This love)
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(This love)
These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love)
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
This love, this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

 

[Intro]
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I (I, I, I, I)

[Verse 1]
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Verse 2]
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Bridge]
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Outro]
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
(I know places)
And you know for me, it's always you
(I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
(I know places)
And I know for you, it's always me
(I know places)
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I

 

[Verse 1]
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

 

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street

 

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Hook: Taylor Swift with Joy Williams of the Civil Wars backup]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with John Paul White of the Civil Wars backup]
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

[Hook]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Bridge: Taylor Swift with the Civil Wars backup]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh

[Hook]
Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Outro: Taylor Swift with the Civil Wars backup]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh oh oh[repeat 'til fade]

 

[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know, is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never (never) be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

[Breakdown]
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never (never) be the same

[Chorus]
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never
(So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same
(We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild)

[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

 

[Verse 1]
It's 2AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

[Chorus 1]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
It's 2AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

[Chorus 2]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Post-Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I

[Bridge]
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)

[Verse 3]
2AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

[Chorus 2]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Outro]
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I wish you would

 

[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda' known

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I shoulda' known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

[Outro]
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you shoulda' known
You shoulda' known
Don't you think I was too young
You shoulda' known

 

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (oh-oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl

[Verse 2]
Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now, you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (oh-oh, oh-oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
And you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
That I don't want you to go, oh, oh

[Breakdown]
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah-yeah
And then you say

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you for worse or for better (worse or for better)
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever (I want you forever and ever)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (this is how it works)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (get the girl)
(That's how it works)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
That's how it works
That's how you got the girl

 

[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

[Post-Chorus]
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

[Breakdown]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

[Post-Chorus]
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Outro]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

 

[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 2]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Chorus]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

[Outro]
Just like our last

 

[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Verse 2]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

[Chorus]
'Cause you threw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Outro]
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

 

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Outro]
All the time

 

[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just want to feel okay again

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

[Breakdown]
But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever going to be is mean, yeah

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever going to be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

 

[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

[Chorus 2]
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it?
(Hold on)
We're gonna make it now
(Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (see it now)

 

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

[Chorus 1]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

[Chorus 1]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
Follow you, follow you home

[Chorus 2]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I

[Breakdown]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
Follow you, follow you home

[Outro]
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it

 

[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Hook]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

[Chorus]
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Outro]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

 

[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

 

[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody]
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Taylor Swift and Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

[Outro: Taylor Swift and Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
(This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list
(Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why
(This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(You break my heart)

[Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

 

[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that, "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say, hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing)
And that was the moment I knew

[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You call me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew

 

[Verse 1]
New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

[Chorus 1]
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive

[Chorus 1]
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

[Pre-Chorus 3]
‘Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

[Chorus 2]
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

 

[Verse 1]
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

[Verse 2]
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

[Bridge]
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

[Outro]
Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back

 

[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now

 

[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're going to be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

[Chorus]
Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're going to believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're going to be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're going to believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was going to marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're going to believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Outro]
Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

 

[Intro]
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Whoa, whoa-ah-oh

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

[Outro]
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (no, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (no)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah?)
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage

 

[Verse 1]
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

[Chorus]
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Verse 2]
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me

[Chorus]
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Bridge]
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back

[Chorus]
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

 

[Verse 1]
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

[Breakdown]
Will you take a moment?
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you

[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

 

[Verse 1]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

[Outro]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

 

[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Verse 2]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah

 

[Verse 1]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm

Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really want to see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus]
And I can't breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

[Verse 2]
Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus]
And I can't breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

[Bridge]
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

[Chorus]
I can't breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

[Outro]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, (Yeah eh) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

 

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

 

[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Bridge]
I know
I know
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it

 

[Verse 1]
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

[Verse 2]
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

[Bridge]
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

[Outro]
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me

 

[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

[Outro]
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The End

 

[Chorus]
I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

[Chorus]
And I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Verse 2]
He said, "Look at you
Worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

[Chorus]
Like, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Breakdown]
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

[Outro]
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?

 

[Verse 1]
You said it in a simple way
4AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

[Chorus]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back be here, come back be here

[Verse 2]
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

[Chorus 2]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Bridge]
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

[Chorus]
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come, back be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

 

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened, please tell me?
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And  it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, you said forever and always, yeah

 

[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

[Breakdown]
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

[Outro]
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

 

[Verse 1]
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days

[Bridge]
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days
And there never was a cloudy day
There never was a cloudy day

 

[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn

[Bridge]
And if you're missing me
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

 

[Intro]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Verse 1]
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you)

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said "speak now"

[Interlude]
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
(Hehe!)

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Chorus - Variation]
And you say
"Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door"
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
"Speak now"

 

So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together

I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said "I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else". So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called "I Know Places". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song

"Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:

Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i

Na na na na waiting at the back door
They're around and the vultures come around
And you know that they won't, they won't us
Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us
And you come and sing and listen
I would not think about it but I'm not done
Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I

Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, no places

Or whatever I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark, lyric like bridge thing and it's about like everyone is trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus. So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing

 

[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, "Okay, let's talk"
And I said

[Hook]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

[Hook]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

[Breakdown]
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Hook]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Outro]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
(ha-ha-ha, it's so fun)

 

So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called "Blank Space," and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the "Oh!" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called "Blank Space."

"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Diamonds, seasides, all those things
[?] this song that [?]
Like, oh my God, listen in
Listen in, I do too
[?]
[?] honest [?]
We can [?]
[All you're?] thinking, all this time
[?]
Oh my God, [?] me
Just forget what you've heard about me
Don't believe what you hear about me, hear about me
'Cause it's gonna be forever, or gonna go -
Yeah! Hey, hey!
Gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over -
This is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track
Long list of ex-love -
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
*Click* I'll write your name
I've got a blank space, baby
*Click* I'll write your name"

 

[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

[Verse 3]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder that I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

[Chorus]
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

 

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red

[Outro]
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street

 

[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

[Chorus]
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me
Mmmm

[Outro]
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"

 

[Verse 1]
The first shots fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, it's not what happened at all
There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you
But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're standing in the ring
And you made your first swing
And now we're fighting dirty
Won't somebody come see break it up

[Chorus]
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So gloves off, if this is how you want it
We had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise
No, no, I'm not the one who tore us apart
Let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine
Is she here? Is she's standing on the sidelines?
Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're standing in the ring
And you made your first swing
And now I'm fighting dirty
But I ain't going down till they break it up

[Chorus]
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Now we're standing in the ring
Breaking everything that we've been building up so long
And I don't wanna do this break it up
But you're not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
Looks like we're going to war

[Chorus]
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Looks like we're going to war
Oh, oh

[Outro]
The first shots fired
Everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I try to take you down
No, no, but if you wanna fight, baby, let's go

 

[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 3]
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

[Chorus]
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

[Outro]
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

 

[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

[Chorus]
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

 

[Verse 1]
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Bridge]
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Outro]
Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself

 

[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again but not this time around

[Hook]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before but

[Hook]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you honey and it never would have gone away
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade so

[Hook]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no...)

 

[Verse 1]
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Verse 2]
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Bridge]
I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
In the middle of the night, we can form this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh

 

[Verse 1]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtain room and this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Outro]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

 

[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

 

[Verse 1]
Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you"
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Bridge]
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you, wary since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door

[Chorus - Variation]
And I say, "Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out"
But I take it all back now

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Outro]
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you want to see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now
Thought you'd be here by now

 

[Intro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Verse 1]
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Verse 2]
I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

[Chorus]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Want to see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Outro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her

 

[Verse 1]
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

[Chorus]
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, finding things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

[Chorus]
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

 

[Verse 1]
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, 'cause I know you

[Chorus]
Hold on
Baby you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

[Verse 2]
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
Not his price to pay

[Chorus]
Hold on
Baby you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
Hold on
Baby you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

[Outro]
You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby

 

[Verse 1]
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted

[Chorus]
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Verse 2]
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

[Chorus]
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Bridge]
You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
(Died for you)

[Chorus]
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

 

[Verse 1]
I'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
Till you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

[Verse 2]
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

[Verse 3]
Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't want to hide anymore
Oh oh

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier

 

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand...

And then he said, "It's too late to apologize"
It's too late...
He said, "It's too late to apologize"
It's too late...

So this is me swallowing my pride (It's too late to apologize)
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night (It's too late...)
And I go back to December (It's too late to apologize, it's too late)
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you (It's too late to apologize)
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine (It's too late...)
Oh...

He said you're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no, no, no...)

 

[Verse 1]
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then you cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Verse 2]
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Bridge]
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (why)
Tell me why (why)

[Outro]
I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know

 

[Verse 1]
Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you?”
I say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Verse 2]
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Bridge]
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

[Breakdown]
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

[Chorus - Variation]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
When you come back down

 

This is another way I've written songs recently. This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes "I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds." And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said "Please, please let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called "I Wish You Would", because Jack wrote back and said "I love that". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:

Okay so this is an idea called "I Wish You Would". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this

It's 2 am, in your car
Windows down, past my street the memories start
It's in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that

Do you like it!?

 

[Verse 1]
She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

[Chorus]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my my my my

[Verse 2]
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my

[Chorus]
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

[Verse 3]
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

[Chorus]
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

[Outro]
I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my

 

[Verse 1]
Once the last drop of rain, has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't [?], but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
You leave it muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls
Of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how we used to be
Like the dollar in your pocket, that's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[Chorus]
I lived, and I learned, had you
Got burned
Held out, held on
God knows, too long, you wasted my time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
No amount of freedom, gets you clean
I still got you all over me

[Verse 2]
Guess the worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "don't you wish you had me" grin
I did, so I smile, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of back then

[Chorus]
Well I lived, and I learned, had you
Got burned
Held out, held on
God knows, too long, you wasted my time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
No amount of freedom gets you clean
I still got you all over me

[Bridge]
I lived, and I learned, and found out what it was to turn around
And see that we were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I tried, and I watched a part of myself die
No amount of freedom, gets you clean
I still got you all over me
I still got you all over me

[Outro]
Na na na, na na na, Na na na, na na na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, all over me
Na na na, na na na, Na na na, na na na
Na na na, all over you, all over me
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah, oh oh oh yeah yeah
Oh oh oh all over me

 

[Verse 1]
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never going to leave you
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

[Verse 2]
I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh, over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath, then jump, then fall into me
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never going to leave you
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

[Bridge]
The bottom's going to drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
And people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is going to come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
Whoa oh, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me

[Chorus]
Be there, never going to leave you
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

[Outro]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

 

[Verse 1]
Corey's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows
These pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home, saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

[Chorus]
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Verse 2]
Corey finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away
I should say
Hey, by the way

[Chorus]
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Bridge]
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

[Chorus]
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?

[Outro]
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na

 

[Verse 1]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

[Chorus]
I just want to show you
She don't even know you
She's never going to love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Verse 2]
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never going to see the light
No matter what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

[Chorus]
I just want to show you
She don't even know you
She's never going to love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Bridge]
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just want to open your eyes
And make you realize

[Chorus - Variation]
I just want to show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Outro]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile

[Verse 1]
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Bridge]
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
Only you can tell

[Chorus]
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
Uh huh
Yeah

 

Foreword

There's an old poem by Neruda that I've always been captivated by, and one of the lines in it has stuck with me ever since the first time I read it. It says "love is so short, forgetting is so long." It's a line I've related to in my saddest moments, when I needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way. And when we're trying to move on the moments we always go back to aren't the mundane ones. They are the moments you saw sparks that weren't really there, felt stars aligning without having any proof, saw your future before it happened, and then saw it slip away without any warning. These are moments of newfound hope, extreme joy, intense passion, wishful thinking, and in some cases, the unthinkable letdown. And in my mind, every one of these memories looks the same to me. I see all of these moments in bright, burning red.

My experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling. And when the dust settled, it was something I’d never take back. Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking. And there's something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that's never coming. And there's something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight, and doesn't fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I’ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I’ve recently fallen in and out of. Love that was treacherous, sad, beautiful, and tragic. But most of all, this record is about love that was red.

[Verse 1]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh)
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you come undone (I, I, I)
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on you knees (eh, eh)
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 1]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

[Verse 2]
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh)
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

[Bridge]
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You've made us proud, you’ve made us proud, proud
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You've made us proud, you've made us proud, proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I’ll be there time and again
Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

 

[Verse 1]
This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Verse 2]
Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Bridge]
You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Outro]
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar...
Superstar

 

[Verse 1]
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

[Chorus]
I’ll leave my window open
‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name
Just know I’m right here hoping
That you’ll come in with the rain

[Verse 2]
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I’ve got you down, I know you by heart
And you don’t even know where I start

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don’t wait for the sky to clear

[Chorus]
I’ll leave my window open
‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name
Just know I’m right here hoping
That you’ll come in with the rain

[Verse 3]
I’ve watched you so long, screamed your name
I don’t know what else I can say

[Chorus]
But I’ll leave my window open
'Cause I’m too tired at night for all these games
Just know I’m right here hoping
That you’ll come in with the rain

[Outro]
I could go back to every laugh
But I don’t want to go there anymore

 

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby
And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
Well, I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie star
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes in me
Gonna strike this match tonight
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'd love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

 

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special

[Chorus]
Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special


And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

 

[Intro: T-Pain]
Hey Hey, T-Swizzle (T-Swizzle)
T-Pizzle (T-Pizzle)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I'm like eight foot fo', blonde hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun, no I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents, but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster, you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delights
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift & T-Pain & Both]
I had a dream last night
I had high top Nikes
I had diamonds in my mouth
And diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing
I'm on a boat, whoa oh-oh
'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty I'm a take ya
You can call me T-Sweezy
Now I'm a rap star
Hey, It's a thug story
Now tell 'em who you are
Singer turned gangster
You don't want to fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee

[Bridge: T-Pain]
T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story now can you get with that?

[Outro: Taylor Swift & T-Pain]
What? What? I knit sweaters, yo!
What? What? Don't test me (beep)!
Hey, hold on...
Hold on, I didn't even say anything
I didn't even s-
What?
I said Yo
Yup
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't even swear
She didn't, she didn- she didn't even swear
Hello? Ugh!

 

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 1]
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 2]
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just got to keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

[Bridge]
Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

[Outro]
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

 

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Outro]
Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh I'm just a girl

 

[Verse 1]
I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Verse 2]
You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

 

[Verse 1]
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Verse 2]
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Verse 3]
And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
What I mean is

[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Outro]
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car to the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

 

[Verse-1]
I could have keyed your car
I could have rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your emails and everything you do
I could have put them to good use

But I'm dressed to kill
And tonight I am going out on a date
With your best friend
He always liked me anyway

[Hook]
R.E.V.E.N.G.E

Jealousy, misery
Gon' give you what you gave to me

Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry, I'm getting my
R.E.V.E.N.G.E

[Verse-2]
So I'm gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory everywhere we've ever been
I don't hang-out at smokey bars, but I know we'll see you there
And I'll make you hear me laughing, like I just don't care

I know you hate my friends, so tonight I called them all
And later on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby!

[Chorus]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse]
We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way?
We say nothing more than we need
I say "your place" when we leave

[Chorus]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, oh, oh

 

[Verse 1]
He said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with"
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back

[Chorus]
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

[Verse 2]
He was lying when he said he moved to L.A
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just seven miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying

[Chorus]
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

[Chorus]
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

[Outro]
In dark blue Tennessee

 

[Enchanted]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Wildest Dreams]
He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
He said no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)

Ooh

[Enchanted]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go

[Wildest Dreams]
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around (follow you around)
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again, even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
(Even if it's just in your)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)

[Enchanted]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go

In your

[Wildest Dreams]
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)

 

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

[Verse]
Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

[Bridge]
It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

 

[Verse 1]
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

[Verse 2]
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while I'll cry
Cause you're my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight cause I-I
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

[Outro]
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes
Beautiful eyes

 

[Chorus]
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

[Verse 1]
Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

[Chorus]
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that is not a lot
I have been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me

[Chorus]
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I do not mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 1]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2]
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ our Saviour is born

[Verse 3]
Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

[Outro]
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

Christ the Saviour is born

 

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said "forever and always"

[Chorus]
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes, thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said "forever and always"

[Chorus]
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

[Bridge]
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so, oh oh oh
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby, back up


[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

[Outro]
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah

 

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Intermission]

[Verse 3]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Outro]
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

 

[Intro]
I never trust a narcissist
Oh but they love me...
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy...
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about...
...me...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Verse]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
It just felt so good

[Bridge]
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
And it's just for fun
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got pitchforks and proof, they don't need their reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up ohh
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up ohh
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up ohh
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Go ahead and light me up...

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Outro]
Oh, they say I did something bad
Why's it feel so good, good?
It just felt so good, good

 

I need you now
Read letters that i wrote on the wall
And the message that i left on my car
I need you now
Words that said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world's a little colder now
But i'm keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you now

I need you now
Words i heard you whispered to me
And we will walk you down a one-way street
You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But i'd come too far to go back there again
My heart, my mind, my mother's a chain
Your mind as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you now

I need you now
Read letters that i wrote on the wall
And the message that i left on my car

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you now

And i'm not what you want
I won't wonder where you are
I won't dream a thousand stars
I don't need you now
I don't need you by the rain
And i never heard you say
I need you, i need you
I don't need you now
Don't need you
I don't need you now

 

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Oh whoa
Oh whoa
Oh whoa

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I’ll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said "There’s another," and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Taylor Swift]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift + Justin Bieber]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can’t believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around, and I'm like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
[?]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Taylor Swift]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

[Outro: Justin Bieber + Taylor Swift]
I'm gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, I'm gone

 

[Verse 1]
I don’t think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
He’ll never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I’m laughing cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

[Chorus]
And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father’s eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I’d lie

[Verse 2]
He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn’t a light go on?
Doesn’t he know that I’ve had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don’t let nobody see me wishing he was mine

[Chorus]
I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father’s eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I’d lie

[Verse 3]
He stands there then walks away
My god if I could only say
I’m holding every breath for you

He’d never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything
But my heart
First thought when I wake up is
My god he’s beautiful
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle

[Chorus]
Yes I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue oh and it kills me
His sisters beautiful he has his father’s eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
I’d lie

 

[Verse 1]
If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby

[Chorus]
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

[Verse 2]
It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

[Chorus]
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me

[Bridge]
We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

[Chorus]
So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

[Outro]
Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look now

 

Taylor's Letter
This album is called "Fearless", and I guess I'd like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, "Fearless" is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you've been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you'e tried before, you've lost. It's fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you can't breathe without them. I think it's fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he's in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing, I think it's fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say "you're NOT sorry", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...That's fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless

[Verse 1]
I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

And hold on... to spinning around...
Confetti... falls to the ground...

[Verse 1: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2: New Year's Day]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge: New Year's Day]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Outro: Long Live]
Long live
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

 

[Verse 1]
Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says "Baby girl what's wrong with you?"
She says "Please don't make me go back there again"

She said "I wish there was some way to make them stop it"
So he drives down to that principal's office and says

[Chorus]
"I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life to see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way"

[Verse 2]
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say

She said "He tried but there's just some things I won't do"
And through the tears she said "I couldn't do that to you"
And he said

[Chorus]
"I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life to see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way"

[Verse 3]
The phone rings on a rainy night, says "It's Officer Tate"
He said "Sir, there's been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily, she's fading fast"

He says "God, I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girl's smile
So please don't take that away, it won't be easy taking her today
She wasn't brought up that way"

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes

[Verse 1]
She walks to school
With her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

[Chorus]
Didn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

[Verse 2]
He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
We're here to die for our God
He stood up and said that's funny
Cause my God died for me
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

[Chorus]
And didn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray to oh

[Verse 3]
The taxis pulled up
On the very day of
They rode 100 floors up
Just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down

[Chorus]
And didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
Where were you
And didn't they pray to
Oh

[Outro]
I walk to school
And I wear a cross
I'm counting
Every day

 

[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (no one has to know)

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Night, in my dreams)
You should see the things we do, baby (We'd do, baby)
In the middle of the night in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Post-Chorus]
Night, in my dreams
We'd do, baby
Yeah, in the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Outro]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby

 

[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around

[Chorus]
Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Bridge]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Outro]
Today was a fairytale

 

[Verse 1]
I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain’t jealous of you
Just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
Cause I'm not trying to show maturity

[Chorus]
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

[Verse 2]
I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess
He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

[Chorus]
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

[Bridge]
And I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seeing how much better off he is

[Chorus]
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart

[Chorus]
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

[Outro]
In permanent marker
Oh, permanent marker

 

[Verse 1]
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I’ve created
I came out alive but I’m black and blue

Before you ask me if I’m alright
Think about what I
Had to do, yeah

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan
And I’ll bet, you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
I've got an "I heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand

[Verse 2]
I'd be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home and cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night
And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan
And I’ll bet, you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
I've got an "I heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand

[Bridge]
And when you're home alone at night
You'll still wonder
Why you took everything I had, oh baby
I had a lot about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know
Someday you will

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we won't make up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I've got an "I heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand

[Outro]
Written on the back of my hand
An "I heart question mark," yeah
Written on the back of my hand

 

[Verse 1]
I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
I'd have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

[Chorus]
And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

[Verse 2]
I should've let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing
And come over here to say
I'm looking good

[Chorus]
But by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

[Verse 3]
By the way
You still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number; just in case
I still miss you
And I still love you
By the way
By the way, oh

 

First Version

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
And I ain't just talking about your face
But look at your face
Oh yeah
And I'm so curious
Your mind got me feeling some type of way
What can I say?
You're gorgeous
(Huh, huh, oh-huh)

I tell 'em [?]

Still Working

You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I've got a boyfriend he's older than us
I haven't seen him in a couple of months
I go through phases when it comes to love
I'm nothing that you want but I must say

I got a boyfriend he's older than us
I haven't seen him in a couple of months

Where will the music industry be in 20 years, 30 years, 50 years?

Before I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying…it's just coming alive

There are many (many) people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently

In recent years, you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it

Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art

Arrows Through the Heart

In mentioning album sales, I'd like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone. It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us

There are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past

However, some artists will be like finding "the one." We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon

I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say "shock"; I said "surprise." I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans?

In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be

There are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento "kids these days" want is a selfie. It's part of the new currency, which seems to be "how many followers you have on Instagram."

Fan Power

A friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around

Another theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country—and to me, that's incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool

This moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted…it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all

Celebrity Spotlight

I predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s, '80s and '90s tell me, "It was never this crazy for us back then!" And I suspect I'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to

And as for me? I'll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism

And I'd also like a nice garden

 

[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
He's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

 

[Verse 1]
Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

[Chorus]
You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

[Verse 2]
Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times
I remember

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while
And I still think about back when"

[Chorus]
We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

[Outro]
Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeah

 

[Verse 1]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now
Yeah I slept, in my makeup again
Tell myself 'I must be crazy'
Thinkin' 'bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you

[Chorus]
I'd be a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Verse 2]
I go to work
Work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
Walk to the car, dig out my keys
Start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]
I'm  a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Bridge]
There you are
On the street
Just standing there, waiting on me
I show you, my new shoes
You say you love them
'Nd baby without you -

[Chorus]
I'm  a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Outro]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now

 

[Verse 1]
American boy, living life as it goes
Sitting on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

[Verse 2]
Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an American beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

[Verse 3]
American boy, raising little babies
Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
That's grown up, American boy

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

 

[Verse 1]
We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were going to buy someday
And we were happy

[Verse 2]
We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sort of how I feel right now
And Goodbye's so much harder
Cause we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were going to buy someday
And we were happy

[Bridge]
Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
Cause we were happy
We Were Happy

[Chorus]
When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were going to buy someday
And we were happy

[Outro]
Yeah, We were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We Were happy

 

[Verse 1]
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It’s like I’m melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Verse 2]
Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can’t take my eyes off you

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Bridge]
All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh, baby, here we are

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
Oh, this is really happening
Oh, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening

[Outro]
Tell me, oh
You’ll always need me
(need me, tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening

 

[Spoken]
You know... You guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

[Verse 1]
Now that he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey

[Hook 1]
Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights are faded
And that heaven is overrated?

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking at yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that he's back from that soul vacation
Tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey

Now that he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Hook 2]
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along in the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?

And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?

Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Hook 3]
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?

And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while
You were looking for yourself?

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?

Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

 

[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

 

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don’t touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity’s too much
And I’ll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I’d be smart to walk away
But you’re quicksand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I, like it

[Verse 2]
I can’t decide if it’s a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you’re friction

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I, like it

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should
Think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home

[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

[Breakdown]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should
Think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home

[Outro]
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I, like it

 

[Verse 1]
Angelina’s got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I’ve never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I don’t cause

[Chorus]
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
He’s got everything you’d wanna be
He’s funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won’t cause

[Chorus]

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But ain’t it funny how
It all comes out
Isn’t life sweet?

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say

[Chorus]

 

[Intro]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me

[Verse 1]
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

Whoa

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you got to do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

[Chorus - Modified]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive

[Outro]
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me

 

[Verse 1]
All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Verse 2]
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Bridge]
Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby

 

You don't have to call me
And say you're sorry
I'm already gone

You don't have to call me
And break my heart
Each time i try movin on, oh

You don't have to call, Anymore
Oh, Yeah
You don't have to call baby

You don't have to call me
And say you're sorry
I'm already gone

You don't have to call me
And break my heart
Each time i try movin on, oh

You don't have to call, Anymore
Oh, Yeah
You don't have to call baby

You don't have to call me
And say you're sorry
I'm already gone

You don't have to call me
And break my heart
Each time i try movin on, oh

You don't have to call, Anymore
Oh, Yeah
You don't have to call baby

 

[Verse 1]
I’m a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring, kinda girl
Hey, yeah, what’s the word on you?
Lay low
I’m a mission rebel, angel devil
Little lamb, upper middle
Sometimes I get temper mental

[Chorus]
But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

[Verse 2]
I’m poetry
Complicated, simply stated
Hey yeah, baby, how about you?
I was born free
I’m a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up, I don’t get up
I just get down, yeah

[Chorus]
But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

[Verse 3]
It’s raining on Sunday
There’s nothin' on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You’re the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can’t stop thinkin' about you
I bet you’re thinkin' of me too

[Chorus]
Well, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

 

[Verse 1]
Please take down the mistletoe
Because I don't want to think about that right now
Because everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you are well
Well I am doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

[Chorus]
I know this should not be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 2]
I have been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

[Chorus]
But for me it is just a lonely time
Because there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 3]
Merry Christmas everybody
That will have to be something I just say this year
I will bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

[Chorus]
I know this should not be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I did not wonder how you are tonight
Because there were Christmases when you were mine

[Outro]
You were mine

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder how it's going to feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

[Chorus]
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

[Verse 2]
I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I want to find
A love that's going to last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

[Chorus]
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love

 

[Verse 1]
I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But I'm not going to talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter
But I'm not going to talk about that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la la, la la la

[Verse 2]
I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me
But I'm not going to say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public
But I'm not going to say that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

[Verse 3]
You might think I'd bring up Joe
The guy who broke up with me on the phone
But I'm not going to mention him
In my monologue
Hey Joe! I'm doing real well
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not going to brag about that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
La la la

[Verse 4]
And if you're wondering if I might
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight
[mouths "Hi Taylor!", blows him a kiss]
I'm not going to comment on that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

[Verse 5]
You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue
But there's nothing more to say
Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue

[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la, la la la la la
That was my SNL monologue

[Verse 1]
Let me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you

[Chorus]
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

[Verse 2]
I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside

[Chorus]
Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

[Bridge]
What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, cause that's what it cost
I just wanna be everything you need
Cause you're everything to me

[Chorus]
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

[Outro]
Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skin

 

[Verse 1]
What do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you want to go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try

[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

[Verse 2]
What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know its real
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday

What do you say?
What do you say?

[Outro]
What do you say?
What do you say?

 

[Verse 1]
Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

[Verse 2]
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasn’t been the same since
That boy she went ran off with, well, I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me

[Bridge]
When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said I’m sorry for waking you up but I didn’t know who else to call
Or where else to go

[Verse 3]
Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
We’re not as young, but we’re still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when we’re old, we’re still going to be

[Outro]
Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear
In the summer shade

 

[Verse 1]
You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half

Everybody said that you were bad news
But baby I was betting on you

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Verse 2]
I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Bridge]
Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

[Verse 3]
Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

 

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1: Bad Blood]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus: Bad Blood]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2: Bad Blood]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus: Bad Blood]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood

[Chorus: Should've Said No]
You should've said, "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Bad blood!)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge: Bad Blood]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

 

[Verse 1]
I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

[Chorus]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

[Verse 2]
If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one will be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
But for someone like you it's just so easy to do

[Chorus]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need

If that's what you need

[Chorus]

 

[Verse 1]
What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me, what would you find?

[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

[Verse 2]
What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?

[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

[Bridge]
We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

[Chorus]
Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

[Outro]
There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more

 

[Verse 1]
Look at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I want to know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

[Chorus]
And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

[Verse 2]
All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All I really want to say is I need to be
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mind

Love love love

[Verse 1]
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world’s a little colder now
But I’m keeping warm somehow

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you
I don’t need you don’t need you now

[Verse 2]
I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street
You need me now
That’s what you’ve been telling my friends
That I’ve come too far to go back there again
My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you
I don’t need you don’t need you now

[Bridge]
I need you now
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I don’t know where you are
I don’t wonder where you are
I don’t dream about you cause I don’t need you now
I don’t dream about the way
That I never heard you say
“I need you I need you”
I don’t need you now

Don’t need you
Don’t need you now

 

[Verse 1]
I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 2]
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 3]
You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better

 

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong

 

[Verse 1]
I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy
When I let too much go
Love’s a little messy and you are too
Right now I’m scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasn’t gonna stray
Swore I’d never let a man in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re the last thing I needed today

[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Verse 2]
Gone and spilled my coffee
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Can’t talk to my friends
Without you coming up
It’s even kind of cute
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good
Right next to mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re the last thing I needed tonight

[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Bridge]
I’m acting like a girl
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring
About anything but you

[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

 

[Verse 1]
Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street?
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Verse 2]
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me?
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Bridge]
You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

 

[Fearless]
There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

[Fearless]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why when with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
So baby drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Fearless]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

[I'm Yours]
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

 

[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved
[Verse One]
Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you?
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek?
'Cause, baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me, sayin'
[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved
[Verse Two]
I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet
[Chorus]
And if you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved
[Verse Three]
Love was all we knew, and faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had, and for one summer, you were mine
Sayin'
[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least I'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

 

[Verse 1]
Watch me go into the world today
Watch me try to blow the past away
Watch me laugh and watch me cry
Watch me fall and watch me fly
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly

[Verse 2]
Watch me catch a star and pin it down
Watch me live another time around
Watch me doubt the things I love
Watch me find what I’m proud of
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly

[Verse 3]
And I may break my wings
And fall flat on my shattered heart
And I may hit the ground
But I will never fall apart
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly

 

[Verse 1]
She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

[Pre-Chorus]
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

[Chorus]
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

[Verse 2]
I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, because  she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

[Pre-Chorus]
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

[Chorus]
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

[Verse 3]
I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there

[Chorus]
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by

[Verse 4]
I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing why

 

Oh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
I want you please let me
Back in your heart

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

I want you back, ohh baby

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

Ohh woah-oh

Oh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
I want you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms

 

[Verse 1]
Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was going to keep

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

[Verse 2]
Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

[Outro]
Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl

 

My name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kind of scared cause
I've never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
Cause I'm going to see my daddy tonight
And she says that

[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
Doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

[Chorus]

James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

[Chorus]

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do

 

[Verse 1]
I can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

[Verse 2]
I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do

[Chorus]
I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

 

[Intro: WANEGBT]
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh

[Chorus: WANEGBT]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Post-Chorus: WANEGBT]
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh

[Transition: TIWWCHNT]
Oh, and here's to my real friends
Oh, and here's to my baby
They didn't care about the he-said-she-said
We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Verse 1: TIWWCHNT]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2: TIWWCHNT]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

[Pre-Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
If only you weren't so shady

[Bridge: TIWWCHNT]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said-she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
(And here's to my baby)
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(He didn't care about that he-said-she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

 

I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your dance smile
That your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But life's too long
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the lines long

And don't you tell me
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well i say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
'Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down

Matches, now

Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.

 

Step one, you say, "We need to talk."
He walks, you say, "Sit down. It's just a talk."
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you

And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

 

[Verse 1]
Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in, and erased it

[Pre-Chorus]
For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

[Verse 2]
Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind

[Pre-Chorus]
And just as I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

[Bridge]
I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

 

[Verse One]
I walk in the room there's a beautiful sunshine ray
Across the room
Then I hear the phone ring walk to it and I don't know what to say
Hello, good day
But what I do know, is that tonight is gonna be the night, when

[Chorus]
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
When, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
When, I'll say, oh, I'll say I love him too
And, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home listenin' to the radio
And, he says he really loves me too, he'll do anything

[Verse Two]
Oh, I walk through the door there's a beautiful moonlight shine
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkin' what I did today
With him
But what I do know, is that, I love him too
And the next time I see
Him walking down the street(down the street)
I'll think about this time, that was as beautiful as sunshine, oh

[Chorus]
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
Yeah, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
And I'll say, I love you too, yeah, I love you
Oh, I'll say, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home, listenin' to the radio
Then, he says, he really loves me and he'll do anything

[Bridge]
I look in his brown eyes, and see a surprise
It's like a present that you open
Oh, and do you know, oh, do you know
What that surprise is?
It's love
And the next time I see him walking down the streets in his old white T-shirt, I'll always remember
This time, that was as beautiful as sunshine

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, sunshine, oh, oh, oh, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, was as beautiful as sunshine

[Verse 1]
I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say


[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!


[Verse 2]
Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Cause you make me feel like flying!


[Chorus]


[Bridge]
Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is

[Chorus]

 

[Verse 1]
My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

[Chorus]
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

[Verse 2]
He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I want to do is say

[Chorus]
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

[Verse 3]
I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

[Chorus]
Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

[Outro]
I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye

 

[Verse 1]
Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

[Verse 2]
In through the window I see her with you
I’m soaked to the skin, you’re warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

[Bridge]
All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling…

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

Down came the rain

 

[Verse 1]
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

Like the tree we carved our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Verse 2]
Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you, oh

[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star


[Bridge]
The night was so cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't see

[Chorus]
And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Outro]
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

 

[Verse 1]
If I could be sweet
I would but first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
Its your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

[Chorus]
If I could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape

[Verse 2]
You let me drown
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Let's look for some common ground
Oh baby
Times been getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully, you don't leave me
Wanna take you with me

[Chorus]
If I could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape

 

[Verse 1]
I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Don’t try me
Don’t fight me
You be you and I’ll be me

[Chorus]
They say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you

[Verse 2]
Your mom and daddy’s walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into
So sorry, don’t worry
I’m sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

[Chorus]
They say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you

[Bridge]
Oh baby, don’t persuade me
I know that you ain’t used to no
So let me say it real slow

[Chorus]
They say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you

[Chorus]
They say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you

 

[Verse 1]
Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that don’t offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go
These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if they’re half as stubborn as me
They’ll just keep on shining bright
I ain’t ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling ain’t strong
I’ll just move on
And leave this in my past


[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how I’ll act today
Until you find somebody new
So I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it


[Verse 2]
Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still don’t know
Oh and it troubles me so


[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how I’ll feel today
I see you found somebody new
And I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it


[Repeat Chorus]


[Outro]
Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smile

 

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair

[Pre-Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
My lover, my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tied
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher over I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she's the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her. When will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Bridge: Nelly
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
Now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

 

[Verse 1]
I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And I know that if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes will you be there?

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
And I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face

[Verse 2]
I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
And I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now I wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you

[Chorus]

 

[Verse 1]
I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

[Chorus]
If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

[Verse 2]
Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you

[Chorus]
And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

[Verse 3]
They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

[Chorus]
Becasue if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

[Outro]
I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever

 

[Verse 1]
I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

[[Pre-Chorus]
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever

[Chorus]
Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

[Verse 2]
I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you say
Do you say what you mean?
When you say our love could last forever

[Chorus]

Oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

[Chorus]
But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Now baby don't you break my heart
Slow

 

What a thing to see
What a thing to be
What a perfect love, what a perfect home
'Cause every time she walks
And every time she talks
Is every time he knows what a perfect world he's living on

But whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

With her midnight hair
And with his favorite stare
She's a southern belle, he's a rockout king
When she looks around
Oh, she knows she's found
Such a perfect life, such a perfect thing

And whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

Oh, there's a reason for every season
There's a change within the range of every heart
But the reason and the season
Seem to be right so far

And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

He calls her "Sugar"

 

[Verse 1]
Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know

[Chorus]
That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

[Verse 2]
Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

[Chorus]
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

[Bridge]
I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

[Chorus]
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

 

Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips are sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush

She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you when she blows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's ferocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She's got Bette Davis eyes

 

[Verse 1]
Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand
And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 1]
I've seen a million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want to speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Verse 2]
Still through the haze I can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 2]
I've played a thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want to sing to you
Waited on a wire
Staring at the fire
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Chorus 3]
I've walked a thousand miles
Smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Outro]
So walk with me as the sweet wind dances
I'll write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights

 

[Verse 1]
On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance

[Chorus 1]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

[Verse 2]
You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

[Chorus 1]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

[Chorus 2]
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

[Bridge]
And it's safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

[Chorus]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

[Chorus 2]
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

[Outro]
Going back to Nashville
I'm going back to Nashville
Going back to Naaaaahh....
Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why?

 

[Verse 1]
Like one of those fireflies
Oh, it looks so good till it's in your hand
It's like one of those memories
Where you can't let go but you just can't stand
It's like one of those crazy dreams
And the permanent screens in the magazines
Saying, "why'd I love?
All it does is break your heart"

[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

[Verse 2]
Like one of those people
With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face
It's like one of those stories
Where the hero dies in the very last race
Like one of those endless cries
And the crazy lies of a hurting child
Saying,"why did love have to hurt?
It broke my heart"

[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

[Bridge]
I always liked to think
That I was always brave enough
To try to master any push and shove
Well I guess I never qualified love

[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

Oh, I guess that's life
Well, I guess that's life

 

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too
You like the bad ones, too
You like the bad ones

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

 

[Verse 1]
She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk

[Verse 2]
School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it
Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

[Chorus]
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you got to love her
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear

[Verse 4]
She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date, can't wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
She thinks about it
Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again
Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer

[Chorus]
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you got to love her
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wear

 

Time is passing slowly for the eight year old next door
But mama's watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair
But girls could say he's just a bit too tall

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know
But they all do and wish that she could see

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

In the least or masterpiece
Depends on one's opinion
Worst of all they never call
But don't think that they weren't wishing

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

It's all in your point of view
Point of view
It's all in your point of view

 

Yo
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

 

[Verse 1]
Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
So take it easy
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Neon Trees!

[Verse 2]
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

[Bridge]
Hush, hush the world is quiet
Hush, hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Well, I won't sleep tonight

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

 

It was something like a perfect start to
This love yesterday but now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes know how to look right through me
It's like, you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you

Could you tell me, what did i do
Because it can't be
We're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me
Is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

Take time, to realise I know that
People change their minds
But that was something i wished you would say
To my face
But you ran away

Could you tell me, what did i do
Because it can't be
We're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me
Is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

If i had a reason
Or a simple goodbye
Baby even a lie
Yeah, yeah

Tell me, what did i do
Because baby
Suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me
Is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
And tell me

Oooh yeah
Tell me
Tell me

 

[Verse 1]
You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But don't ruin yourself I aren’t your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

[Hook]
I want to talk about what you are that I aren’t
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

[Verse 2]
I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I tell them, "this is what I do"
And it’s what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition

[Hook]
I want to talk about what you are that I aren’t
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games

[Hook]
So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be, girl, and who I've always been

 

[Verse 1]
Isn't it funny how many times we can say
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page
And moved on
That's what we thought

But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

[Verse 2]
You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just, baby, get along with me

[Chorus]

 

I don’t need a lot
But there is one thing
Love has taught me
It’s to never expect too much
Don’t need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you
And I might, I found life
Why should we be wasting time?

You don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view

Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summer’s eve
No offense to them but they ain't got nothing on you
Walking with you
In the light or in the dark
Well nothing shadows who you are

And you don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view

I look outside the window
Everyday see something new
But all I ever wanted was a
Window looking at you, at you

And you don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
You don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view

 

[Verse 1]
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside?
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Bridge]
I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Outro]
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out

 

[Verse 1]
You look at me
I fake a smile so you won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl ya talk about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
You talk to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when you're with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You say you're so in love, you finally got it right
I wonder if you know you're all I think about at night

[Chorus]
You're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
You're the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
You walk by me
Can't you tell that I can't breathe?
And there you go, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold ya tight, give you all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

[Chorus]
You're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
You're the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Chorus]
You're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
You're the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Outro]
You're the time taken up, but there's never enough
And you're all that I need to fall into
You look at me
I fake a smile so you won't see

 

[Verse 1]
One daybreak, one heartache
Every once-upon-a-time
That black dress, happiness
Bubble baths and quarter lines

[Pre-Chorus]
They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

[Chorus]
Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

[Verse 2]
Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out bad
One last stands, new romance
Living for that love and person

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Ohh, yeah
Ohh

[Bridge]
No fighting, black riding
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things

[Outro]
Na na na...
Oh, yeah
Na na na...
Ohh, yeah
Na na na...

 

There's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it
'Cause I swear out there ain't where
You outta be
So catch a ride or catch a cab
Don't you know that I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby run cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run
So baby run

Oh if you ain't got a suitcase
Get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby just come back
There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it
Baby break it

Baby run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

Run to me
Baby run
Run to me
So baby run
Run
Oh baby run

 

[Verse I]
... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

[Chorus]
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

[Verse 2]
You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky

 

[Verse 1]
I need you more than I know how to mention
And I'd give forever to get your attention
Be you're summer midnight with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

[Chorus]
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

[Verse 2]
All of the days that I couldn't get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Heaven had quite the time
To figure this life out
But baby I've got mine
To give you everything you dream about

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]

 

[Verse 1]
Here I am, once again
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving
I should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing
You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head
So goodbye, it's not goodnight
Cause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
You got me, you do

[Verse 2]
In a daze, pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax, I go back to all the things you said
That only I know

[Chorus]


[Bridge]
I'm runnin' right out to my car
And I pull out the drive
It's only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time

[Chorus]

 

[Verse 1]
Are you trying to make me fall?
'Cause with a face like that, baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

[Verse 2]
Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

[Bridge]
Na na na na na na na na na na na
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh..

[Chorus]

 

[Verse 1]
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can't

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah

[Verse 2]
The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

[Verse 3]
And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me

[Outro]
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin

 

[Stay Stay Stay]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I've read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said "okay, let's talk"
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life

[Ho Hey]
Ho, hey, ho, hey
So show your family
All the blood that I would bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song

I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart 
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart

[Verse 1]
Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were calling my name
When your face faded from view

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

[Chorus]
Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

[Verse 2]
Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were going to be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a Nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the Indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

[Chorus]
Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah, oh

 

[Verse 1]
There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you

[Verse 2]
She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you

[Bridge]
Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you aren’t so far away

[Chorus]
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you

 

I’ve been counting days and
I’ve been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t want to jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Dreaming of you baby
I’ve been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
‘Cause I’ve been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if you’ve seen one
I’d like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

[Chorus x2]

 

[Verse 1]
Your feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

[Chorus]
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

[Verse 2]
You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

Oh oh

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Made Up You

Oh oh

Made Up You

 

[Verse 1]
Days go by, I wonder if you hear me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

[Chorus]
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

[Verse 2]
He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is you

 

[Verse 1]
I said I know
He said need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
I watched him go
He watched me crushed to the floor
On my knees, just like that
He said, "When can I come back?"

[Chorus]
I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when

[Verse 2]
I said I know
He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this
'Cause I let you go, you let me think
That I'll be fine without you
Imagine that!
So baby I'll come back

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I said all this playing
Did you ever think of me?
And he said

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I said I know
He said I need some time, need some space

 

[Intro]
To the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff, yes, I bought it
Please don't touch

[Verse One]
Keep talking and yes, that's fine
Could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on the tag
Come in with your bags, let me call you a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard, telling me how I'm such a fool
How I'm never gonna find a man like you, got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you, ever for a second, get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Verse Two]
So, go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What'd you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you were untrue, hauling her around in the truck that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys, hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard, telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking about, how I'm never gonna find a man like you
Got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you, ever for a second, get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

 

[Verse 1]
Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

[Chorus]
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Fall Out Boy's from Chicago!

[Verse 2]
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

[Chorus]
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

 

[Verse 1]
He's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine
People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill

[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

[Verse 2]
Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

[Bridge]
Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolin

 

[Verse 1]
I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going

[Verse 2]
They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

[Bridge]
I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

 

[Verse 1]
It's strange to think
The songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said "yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should have known the word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no baby and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth this?
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no baby and you might still have me

 

[Verse 1]
Something about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

[Verse 2]
You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

[Bridge]
Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

 

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
I may be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

 

I'm still wearing my blue jeans
No I don't know what you mean
I'm still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
I've always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
I've always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
I've always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking...

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

[Verse 1]
I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that’s good enough for me
Don’t need the real thing
That’s just another thing
For me to try to tame
Don’t know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be a riding off with him

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

[Verse 2]
Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be a riding off with him

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

[Bridge]
It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I’ll never look
At a sunset the same night

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

 

[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

[Chorus 2]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z

[Verse 1]
I can cast a spell
See, but you can't tell
Mix a special groove
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly
I will appear

[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

[Chorus 2]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z

[Verse 2]
I can set your knees
Like playing unto the seas
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
I got it, I got it
I got it, got it, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

[Chorus 2]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman (every woman)
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

[Chorus 2]
Anything you want
I'm every woman
It's all in me (yeah, oh, yeah)
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Yeah, oh
I'm every woman
It's all in me

[Verse 1]
Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

[Chorus]
And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

[Verse 2]
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

[Chorus]
Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything

[Verse 1]
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But, baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

[Chorus]
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

[Verse 2]
My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"
My heart is saying, "Don't let go
Hold on till the end"
And that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

[Chorus]
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

 

[?] bad days, tell me, I'll [?]
[?] look so sad? You feel [?]
[?] know you thought you had it
I know all about that
You had planned out, saw the [?]
You, I'm a dreamer, too
Lost the [?] but I'll be right [?]
And I'll take care of you

If you get knocked off your feet
I'll try to see it coming
I'll get a symphony to play that song [?] [love?]
Pick you up, take your hand, stop your crying
There's no chance you won't make it through
I'm looking out for you

Beneath those scared eyes
There's something wonderful
That you don't know you have
I know you're scared but I'd pass up a miracle
Just to hear you laugh

If you get tired of me, I'll pretend to let you go
If you need room to breathe, step back and watch you go

Sweet child, you've seen better days
But you know it's gonna be okay
Show me that smile you got from your father
It's gonna be fine just because you got my love, you got my love

 

[Verse 1]
You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "that's a lie"
Just a boy in a pickup truck
That had a funny way of getting stuck
On backroads at night

[Pre-Chorus]
I was right there beside you all summer long
Then in time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
Thanking God that you weren't here
To see me like that
In a box beneath my bed
Sits a letter that you never read
From three summers back

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard not to find it all bittersweet
But looking back on all of that it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

[Bridge]
Been back a couple times since then
And I didn't look you up
But some trains you can't catch again
You gotta leave it as it was

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
When you think Tim McGraw
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

[Outro]
You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "that's a lie"

 

[Verse One]
Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just try your best, try everything you can
Don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away

[Chorus]
It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

[Verse Two]
Hey, you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own
So don't buy in love right now
Just be yourself, it doesn't matter if it's good enough for someone else

[Chorus]
It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright(x2)

[Verse Three]
Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just do your best, do everything you can
Don't you worry what their bitter hearts are gonna say

[Chorus]
It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright

 

[Verse 1]
Any day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

[Verse 2]
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're going to be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

[Verse 3]
Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't going to take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

[Verse 4]
Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

[Outro]
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

 

[Verse 1]
I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

[Pre-Chorus]
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

[Verse 2]
Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you

[Pre-Chorus]
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

[Verse 3]
I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fade

 

[Verse 1]
Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

[Verse 2]
It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

[Bridge]
Were you a present from a father to a son?
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone?
Hey, did some primadonna love you
'Til she got her fame and fortune?
I won't do that to you

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend?
This here guitar
You're my guitar
This here guitar

 

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think, she's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you want to go
They don't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think, she's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For things that she does on the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word

Woah

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think, she's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For things that she does on the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
'Cause I don't think you do
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do
Don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
Come on, show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

 

[Verse 1: You're Not Sorry]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no

[Verse 2: You're Not Sorry]
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you didn't leave me waiting in the cold
You've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no
You're not sorry, no

[Bridge: You're Not Sorry]
You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Pre-Chorus: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around]
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
I'm so confused about it 
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Won't you tell me, is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you go around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay, baby
'Cause in time you will find

[Chorus: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around]
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around 
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around

[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Outro: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around (Bridge)]
You spend your nights alone
And she never comes home
And when you call her up, all you get's a busy tone
And she's doing to you, what you did to me
A tale as old as time
Boy, you got what you deserved

 

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer

[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
No sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why? All the possibilities
Well, I was wrong

[Chorus 1: Hayley Williams with (Taylor Swift)]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities
I'm sure you've heard

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with (Hayley Williams)]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)

[Bridge: Hayley Williams]
Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!

[Breakdown: Taylor Swift and Hayley Williams]
Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah

[Chorus: Hayley Williams and Taylor Swift]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah
Now, I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, woah

 

[Verse 1]
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, until the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
75 Johnson and an electric choke
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
I would make it whine
He'd say, "You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides"
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip, we'd haul trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

[Chorus]
It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower, girl
You're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
Soon I'll be grown up
With daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Steer it left, and turn it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
Oh, he let me drive
Oh, he let me drive

[Outro]
It's just an old plywood boat
With a 75 johnson
And electric choke

 

[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody]
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Hook: Both]
And right before your eyes
I’m breaking
No fuss, no reasons why
Just you and me
(e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he)

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Hook: Both]
And right before your eyes
I’m aching
No fuss, nowhere to hide
Just you and me
(e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he)

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)

[Bridge: Taylor Swift and Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong
This is the last time I say it’s been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

[Outro: Both]
This is the last time I’m asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I’m asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

 

Oh baby, give me one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart?
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms (I want you back)

Can we have it be, like, like, lots of vocals, like, um, like lots of people singing the pre, so they can start saying "sa-lute to me like a-" 'cause I need "salute." 'Cause I like that lyric

[Pre-Chorus]
Like trying on clothes, salute to me like the American dream

Salute to me, I'm your American queen

And we rule the kingdom inside my room

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

1 Day Later
[Bridge]
Is the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on your roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
All at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
The Next Day
[Taylor]
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"
Yeah, thanks!
Hanging out with you guys is enough, I'm starting to do weird melody, weird harmonies
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"
"Your love is, your love is," okay
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"

 

[Verse 1]
It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It would've been good for you to be there
And every time you always would
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time
And nothing seems to be a blur

[Chorus]
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you

[Verse 2]
Would've been cool to never fall down
But then I never would've seen
The power isn't with the picture perfect person
You told me better things to come from in between

[Chorus]
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one, saying one, saying one for you

[Bridge]
It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes

[Chorus - Shortened]
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you

 

[Verse 1]
I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think Romeo would be my kind of guy
I want a love that's sweeter than roses
And for me this is how it's gonna be

[Chorus]
Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

[Verse 2]
Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
I'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
It's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect

[Chorus]
Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And he music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

I want my own little storybook ending
We'll make it up as we go

[Chorus]
There's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet
I want love they haven't thought of yet

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
Cause they're all wrong
I know better, cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
That last kiss, I'll cherish, until we meet again
My darling, who knew?

Because P!nk is from Philly, ladies and gentlemen!

I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
They can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that make me feel
So
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Make you feel unpretty too

That's another song by an artist from Philly, I wanna see if you know it

Taylor Swift
Taylor Swift
Taylor Swift
Taylor Swift, lying to address-
Global superstar Taylor Swift
This is the first time photographers have caught T-Swift on film in six weeks
Taylor Swift
Taylor Swift
Grammys youngest ever winner of Album of the Year, Fearless
Is there Bad Blood?
Taylor Swift is responsible for me being suspended
Taylor Swift is an [?] again
Taylor Swift is on top of the world, but has she done some sketchy things to get there?
Thirteen celebs have issues with Taylor Swift
I felt like she was a little angry
Number thirteen
There she is leaving a restaurant
She holds too many grudges
Why did Taylor Swift-
You can see her through the very [?]
I can see her
I can understand trying to keep your relationship to yourself at the beginning, or needing to take some time to work on your craft
But come on
And Taylor, voluntarily bringing attention to herself of her donations
What Swift did is not enough
Yeah, okay Tay, Whatever you say
I, I hate to say this, but I think Taylor Swift is learning a few lessons in life
All this drama is exhausting
Taylor Swift should focus on making the rest of reputation
Reputation
What it is-
Reputation
Taylor Swifts new romance is heating up
Reputation
And what has happened to the squad
Reputation
But at the same time, I think both-
Reputation
Taylor Swift takes the stand in court today
Taylor Swifts reputation
Reputation
Reputation
So instead we'll talk about Taylor Swifts reputation
Reputation
Reputation
So instead we'll talk about Taylor Swifts reputation
Reputation
Taylor Swifts reputation
So instead we'll talk about Taylor Swifts reputation

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dark night on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Delicate

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, your mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)

Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Delicate

Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the  time

'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)

Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?

'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?

'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Delicate

 

I loved you for a little, a little while
I think you know that!
It would have worked for a little
Except for that day you...
It's not like you to be here
When you said you won't!

But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
It's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain
It kills me to say this
It really does, it kills my heart!
But I might still love you
Reason we're just fallen apart
But it's not like me to answer
Gonna change my mind!


But in the pouring rain, You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
And it's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain

Oh, am I...
All I torn myself I would be losing!
But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?
My tears are falling down from the sky!
In the pouring rain, I can feel...
I wonder who you love tonight
Oh, in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
Oh, in the pouring rain!
In the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed my mind

[Intro]
All this time, time, time...
All this time, time, time...

[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before but

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you honey and it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade so

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
(Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no)

 

Lembrei desse sentimento
Gritando dentro de nós
Éramos todos meninos
Em cada um vivia uma paixão
Como uma cena de um filme
Vencemos pesadelos enfrentando os dragões
Criados por nossos medos
Fruto da imaginação

De frente a uma nova era
Na onda de uma canção
Nós construímos a história
Mente, alma e coração

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

De frente a uma nova era
Na onda de uma canção
Nós construímos a história
Mente, alma e coração

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Lembrei do momento
Que fiz promessa pra nós dois
Pintando o nosso destino
Puro e simples, pleno e sem fim
Que fosse assim sem um goodbye
Fosse para sempre um cheguei
Os sonhos que construímos
Me vi feliz, eu te achei

Será muito mais que achar
Será muito além de pensar

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long long live the look and your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

 

[Verse 1]
Should have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear john
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

[Verse 2]
So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking
Round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus]

 

[Chorus]

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 1]

Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time

[Chorus]

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
Let me hear you please make some noise for my band

[Verse 2]

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go
Give it up for my guitarist LA!

[Chorus]

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

[Bridge]

Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said
"Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

[Chorus]

"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say yes"

[Bridge]

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

[Chorus]

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

 

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
“Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!”

One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

[Niall Horan:]
"We should take this back to my place"
That's what she said right to my face
Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby
I've been thinking 'bout it all day
And I hope you feel the same way, yeah
Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

[Niall & Taylor Swift:]
Slow, slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those
Slow hands
Slow hands

[Taylor:]
I just wanna take my time
We could do this, baby, all night, yeah
Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

[Niall & Taylor:]
Slow, slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those
Slow hands

[Niall:]
Fingertips puttin' on a show
Got me now and I can't say no
Wanna be with you all alone
Take me home, take me home

[Taylor:]
Fingertips puttin' on a show

[Niall:]
Can't you tell that I want you, baby, yeah

[Niall & Taylor:]
Slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'

Slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those slow hands
Your slow hands
Ooh, slow hands

 

Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home

Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here, and

Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze

Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here, and

Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back, back to where I feel so free
Well, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee

I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
And I'm in Tennessee

 

[Intro]

Baby let the games begin
Baby let the games begin
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin now
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin now
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin now
Baby let the games begin

Are you ready for it?

[Verse 1]

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Chorus]

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]

Me, I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island-and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every lover known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Chorus]
I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
(No one has to know)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Ooh, are you ready for it?

[Bridge]

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Chorus]

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

[Verse 3]

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

 

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life, by not being mine

[Chorus]

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But, what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (to your face)
'Cause look at your face (look at your face)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Speech]

And now Swansea I'd like to introduce you to the incredible gorgeous women on this stage tonight
Say hello to Jazz
Gracie
Camila
Jeslyn
Bellany
Nadine
Stephanie
Yoe
Elliot
And I'm Taylor, it's good to see you tonight

[Bridge]

You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Alone, unless you wanna come along, oh

[Chorus]

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (to your face)
'Cause look at your face (look at your face)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous

 

(Verse 1)
There's somethin' bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin' me want you

(Chorus)
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

(Verse 2)
So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In New Jersey now capture it remember it

(Chorus)
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

(Bridge)
Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless


(Chorus)
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
Oh-uh
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
