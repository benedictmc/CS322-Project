[Verse 1]
Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in this moment, this order's tall

[Chorus]
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

[Verse 2]
Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

[Chorus]
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

[Verse 3]
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?

 

[Verse 1]
"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
And at once, I knew I was not magnificent

[Chorus]
Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

[Verse 2]
3rd and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And at once, I knew I was not magnificent

[Chorus]
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

[Verse 3]
Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory

[Pre-Chorus]
And at once, I knew I was not magnificent

[Chorus]
High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

 

[Verse 1]
Down along the creek
I remember something
Her, the heron hurried away
When first I breeched that last Sunday (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Low moon don the yellow road
I remember something
That leaving wasn't easing all that heaving in my vines
And as certain it is evening 'at is NOW is not the Time (Oooh)

[Verse 3]
Toiling with your blood
I remember something
In B, un—rationed kissing on a night second to last
Finding both your hands as second sun came past the glass
And oh, I know it felt right and I had you in my grasp

[Verse 4]
Oh then, how we gonna cry?
Cause it once might not mean something?
Love, a second glance, it is not something that we'll need
Honey, understand that I have been left here in the reeds
But all I'm trying to do is get my feet out from the crease

[Outro]
And I see you
Turn around, you're my A Team
Turn around, now you're my A Team
God damn, turn around now
You're my A Team

 

[Intro]
(When we leave this room it's gone)

[Verse 1]
Is the company stalling?
We had what we wanted: your eyes
(When we leave this room it's gone)
With no word from the former
I'd be happy as hell if you stayed for tea
(I know so well that this is all there is)
This is how we grow now, woman
A child ignored
These will just be places to me now
The foreman is down
(When we leave this room it's gone)
We're rising the stairs

[Pre-Chorus]
​I find God
And religion, too...

[Chorus]
Staying at the Ace Hotel
If the calm would allow
Then I would just be floating to you now
It would make me pass to let it pass on
I'm climbing the dash, that skin

[Post-Chorus]
(Here in this room, this narrow room
Where life began when we were young last night)

[Verse 2]
Well we walked up on that bolt in the street
After you tied me in in the driveway of the apartment of his bede
Sent your sister home in a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I woulda walked across any thousand lands
(No not really if you can't)
I didn't need you that night
Not gonna need you anytime
Was gonna take it as it goes
I could go forward in the light
Well I better fold my clothes

[Chorus]
(I’ll be looking through your eyes)
All my goodness
(I’ll be looking through your eyes)
(I’ll be looking through your eyes)
All my goodness to show
(Why are you so far from saving me?)
(Why are you so far from saving me?)

 

[Verse 1]
Philosophize your figure
What I have and haven't held
You called and I came, stayed tall through it all
Fall and fixture just the same thing
Say nothing of my fable, no
What on earth is left to come
Who's agonized and gnawed through it all
I'm underneath your tongue
I'm standing in your street now, no
And I carry his guitar
And I can't recall it lightly at all
But I know I'm going in
Too much for me to pick up, no
Not sure what forgiveness is
We've galvanized the squall of it all
I can leave behind the harbour

[Chorus]
I will run (all around it)
Have to crawl (still can't stop it)
Along the fires
One more time just pass me by
I'mma make it half the night
Hall light wishes

[Verse 2]
To walk aside your favor
I'm an Astuary King
I'll keep in a cave, your comfort and all
Unburdened and becoming

[Chorus]
I will run (all around it)
(Sailing off and on, you're on your honor)
Have to crawl (carry off and up your seize)
Still can't— (Along—)
I will run (carry up love along unfettered time)

[Outro]
Now Mona (Now Mona)
Haven't I locked up my failure (sailing off and ore your odd, your honour)
From the core to the sky
Wouldn't I be last to see? (carry off and up your seize)
From the door till we die
Deny with love my labour (carry up with love a long)
Was it all I could find (atonements defined)
Keep waking up high

 

[Verse 1]
This my excavation and to–
–day is Kumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain, this is paralyzed
I keep throwing it down two
Hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone and you're drunk as hell

[Chorus]
On your back with the racks as the stacks of your load
In the back with the racks and the stacks are your load
In the back with the racks and you're unstacking your load

[Verse 2]
I've been twisting to the sun
I needed to replace
And the fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down in a frozen ground
There's a black crow sitting across from me
His wiry legs are crossed
He's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss?

[Chorus]
On your back with your racks as the stacks of your load
In the back with the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're unstacking your load

[Verse 3]
This is not the sound of a new man
Or crispy realization
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
Your love will be safe with me

 

[Verse 1]
Sharing smoke
In the stair up off the hot car lot
Sun shine hard on the video spot
Hm, mm, mm, mm
Sure as any living dream
It's not all then what it seems
And the whole thing's hauled away

[Chorus]
A womb
An empty robe
Enough
You're rolling up
You're holding it
You're fabric now

Paramind
Paramind

[Verse 2]
Hallucinating Claire
Nor the snow shoe light or the autumns
Threw the meaning out the door
(Now could you be a friend)
There ain't no meaning anymore
(Come and kiss me here again)

[Chorus]
A womb
An empty robe
Enough
You're rolling up
You're holding out
You're bent prize

Canonize
Canonize

[Bridge]
Motor up and yeah, you're own, ooh
And yeah you're on your own

(Marijuana has you talkin'...)

[Verse 3]
Fold the map and mend the gap
And I tow the word companion
And I make my self escape
Oh, the multitude of other
It comes always off the page

[Chorus]
I hold the note
You wrote and know
You've buried all your alimony butterflies

[Post-Chorus]
Sub find
Some night

 

[Verse 1]
Must've been forces, that took me on them wild courses
Who knows how many poses that I've been in
But them the main closest, hark! It gives meaning mine
I cannot really post this, ah feel the signs

[Chorus]
I worried 'bout rain and I worried bout lightning
But I watched them off to the light of the morning
Marking the slope, slung low in the highlands
(Where the days have no numbers)
If it's harmed, it's harmed me, it'll harm, I let it in

[Verse 2]
Oh, the old modus: out to be leading live
Said, comes the old ponens, demit to strive
A word about Gnosis: it ain't gonna buy the groceries
Or middle-out locusts, or weigh to find

[Chorus]
I hurry 'bout shame and I worry 'bout a worn path
And I wander off, just to come back home
Turning to waltz, hold high in the lowlands
(Cause the days have no numbers)
It harms me, it harms me, it harms like a lamb

[Verse 3]
So I can depose this, partial to the bleeding vines
Suppose you can't hold shit, how high I've been
What a river don't know is to climb out and heed a line
To slow among roses or stay behind

[Chorus]
I've been to that grove
Where no matter the source is
And I walked it off, how long I'd last
Sore-ring to cope, whole band on the canyon
(When the days have no numbers)
Well it harms, it harms me, it harms, I'll let it in

 

Ever since I heard the howlin' wind
I didn't need to go where a bible went
But then you know your gifts seemed heaven sent
Just lead me to a choler, dad, that's the thing

I don't know how you house the sin
But you're free now
I was never sure how much of you I could let in
Am I free now
Won't you settle down baby here your love has been
Heavenly father
It’s defiantly lava
Why you don't carry other names?

Heard about a day where it dropped the Know
To go another day as we learn to close
Cause I'm a known coward in a coward wind
But you’re free now
You turn around now and you count to 10
To see you go now
Well I know now honey that I can't pretend
Heavenly father
Is whose brought to his autumn
And love is left in end

I just been up here for god damn years
Can you see now?
Filling up hulls with god damn fears
I am free now
I know about it darlin', I've been standin' here
Heavenly father
Is all that he offers
A safety in the end

 

[Verse 1]
(It might be over soon, two two)
Where you gonna look for confirmation?
And if it's ever gonna happen
So as I'm standing at the station
It might be over soon

[Verse 2]
(All these years)
There I find you marked in constellation (two, two)
There isn't ceiling in our garden
And then I draw an ear on you
So I can speak into the silence
It might be over soon (two, do, two)
(It might be over soon) two, two

[Verse 3]
(And I'm gonna shout all my trouble over)
Oh and I have carried consecration
And then You expelled all decision
As I may stand up with a vision
Caught daylight, goddamn right
Within a rise there lies a scission
(It might be over soon)

 

[Narrator]
(So apropos:
Saw death on a sunny snow)

[Him]
"For every life..."

[Her]
"Forgo the parable."

[Him]
"Seek the light."

[Her]
"...My knees are cold."

(Running home, running home, running home, running home...)

"Go find another lover;
To bring a... to string along!"
"With all your lies
You're still very lovable."

"I toured the light; so many foreign roads for Emma, forever ago."

 

[Verse 1]
I am my mother's only one
It's enough
I wear my garment so it shows
Now you know

[Chorus 1]
Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon

[Verse 2]
I am my mother on the wall
With us all
I move in water, shore to shore
Nothing's more

[Chorus 2]
Only love is all maroon
Lapping lakes like leery loons
Leaving rope burns, reddish ruse

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 1]
Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon

 

[Verse 1]
Sixes hang in the door
What kind of shit to ignore
I've cut the cloth
(Ooh, hard line circle)
How to know who to write
How to know who can cull up all the questions
(We know that I'm right, cause)
To clean out a night
I fell in love

[Chorus 1]
I heard about it
(bit by bit, bit by bit)
I heard about it
(bit by bit, bit by bit)
I heard about it
(bit by bit, bit by bit)
Oh

[Verse 2]
And so it's not in your clasp
Then what's the function or the task
Well, I'd stun and I'd stammer
Help me reach the hammer
For then what will I ask?

That's a pair of them docks
Mooring out two separate lochs
Ain't that some kind of quandry
(Waundry)
Take me into your palms
What is left when unhungry?

[Chorus 2]
I learned about it
(bit by bit, bit by bit)
I learned about it
(bit by bit, bit by bit)
I've learned about it
(bit by bit, bit by bit)
Oh

[Verse 3]
I'm still standing in
Still standing in the need of prayer
The need of prayer
No, I don't know the path
Or what kind of pith I've amassed
Long lines of questions
Lessons
(Lessons)
Lessons
But what do you lose to concede?
(I move my feet, I move my feet)

And yes it's hard to believe
When 'em sold for your sleeves
Just come off of your kneel
Please, please, please
I can admit to conceal
No, that's not how that's supposed to feel
Oh, no
It's not for broader appeal
Fuck the fashion of it, dear

[Chorus 3]
I've laughed about it
(bit by bit, bit by bit)
I've laughed about it
(bit by bit, bit by bit)
I've laughed about it
(bit by bit, bit by bit)
Oh

 

[Verse 1]
Someday, my pain
Someday, my pain will mark you
Harness your blame
Harness your blame and walk through

[Chorus 1]
With the wild wolves around you
In the morning, I'll call you
Send it farther on

[Verse 2]
Solace my game
Solace my game, it stars you
Swing wide your crane
Swing wide your crane and run me through

[Chorus 2]
And the story's all over you
In the morning, I'll call you
Can't you find a clue
When your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue?

[Bridge]
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost (Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost (Don't bother me)
What might have been lost (Don't bother me)
What might have been (Don't bother me)
What might have been (Don't bother me)
What might have been lost (Don't bother me)
What might have been lost (Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh

[Outro]
Someday, my pain
Someday, my pain
Someday, my pain
Someday, my pain

 

[Verse 1]
I’m tearing up
Across your face
Move dust through the light
To fide your name
It's something fane
This is not a place
Not yet awake
I'm raised of make

[Chorus]
Still alive, you who love
Still alive, you who love
Still alive, you who love

[Verse 2]
In a mother, out a moth
Furling forests for the soft
Gotta know been lead aloft
So I'm ridding all your stories
What I know, what it is, it's pouring; wire it up
You're breaking your ground

 

[Verse One]
Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices, inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize me
Don't patronize me

[Hook]
Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something it won't
Here in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I feel the power but you don't
No, you don't
Cause I can't make you love me, If you don't
If you don't
No you won't

[Verse Two]
I close my eyes
I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

[Hook]
Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
I feel the power but you don't
No you don't
I can't make you love me if you don't
If you don't

[Outro]
No, no, no, you won't
I found love darling
I found love darling
I found love darling
I found love darling, yeah
I found love darling, darling, darling
Love in the nick of time
I found love darling, yeah
Love in the nick of time

 

[Verse 1]
Well I been carved in fire
Well I been carved in fire
I been caught in fire, whaaaa
Well I been caught in fire
I been carved in fire
I been caught in fire
What comes prior to

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I been caught in a fire
I stayed down the other night
I been caught in fire
I stayed down
(Without knowing what the truth is)
I been caught in fire
I stayed down the other night
(5 lane divers)
I been caught in fire
I stayed down
(Without knowing what the truth is)

[Outro]
Fire
(Fire)

 

[Verse 1]
Errant heat to the star
And the rain let in
And the hawser rolls, the vessel's whole and Christ, it's thin

[Chorus 1]
Well, Iʼd know that you'd offer
Would reveal it, though it's soft and flat
Won't repeat it, cull and coffers that
For the soffit, hang this homeward
Pry it open with your love
Sending lost and alone standing offers

[Verse 2]
It is steep, it is stone
Such recovery
From the daily press, the deepest nest, in keeper's keep
All the news at the door
Such a revelry
Well, it's hocked inside of everything you said to me

[Chorus 2]
It was found what we orphaned
Didn't mention it would serve us picked
Said your love is known, I'm standing up on it
Aren't we married?!
I ainʼt living in the dark no more
It's not a promise, Iʼm just gonna call it

[Verse 3]
Heavy mitted love
Our love is a star
Sure some hazardry
For the light before and after most indefinitely
Danger has been stole away

[Outro]
This is Axiom

 

[Verse 1]
Well, I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags
You said "See, look, that's yours
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another's
Even in their plastic little covers?"

[Chorus]
And I said I know it well
That secret that you know
But don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good girl
Because it's running you with red

[Verse 3]
Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands
Chewing on a candy bar
You said "Ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this?"
As a moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss

[Chorus]
And I said I know it well
That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor
I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs, babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

[Outro]
And I know it well
I know it well
And I know it well
I know it well
And I know it well
I know it well
And I know it well
I know it well

 

[Verse 1]
I was full by your count
I was lost but your fool
Was a long visit wrong?
Say you are the only

[Chorus]
So many foreign worlds, so relatively fucked
So ready for us, so ready for us
The creature fear

[Verse 2]
I was teased by your blouse
Spit out by your mouth
I was loud by your lowered
Seminary sold
Tear on, tail on
Take all on the wind on
The soft bloody nose
Sign another floor

[Chorus]
So many territories, ready to reform
Don’t let it form us, don’t let it form us
The creature fear
So did he foil his own? Is he ready to reform?
So many Torahs, so many for us
The creature fear

 

Fe, fever rest
Fever rest
(Wild heart, wild heart)
I cut you in
Deafening
Fever rest
(Darling didn't love right)
I been sleeping in a stable, mate
Not gonna do you no favors
What I got is seen you trying
Or take it down the old lanes around
Fuckified
Darling don't make love
Fight it
Love, don't fight it
Love, don't fight it
Love...
Well I'll wrap you up
And I take it by the touch
Darling don't a failure fright
Times the raker
And I'll rack it up
I'm unorphaned in our northern lights
Dedicoding every daemon
Taken in the tall grass of the mountain cable
And I cannot seem to find I'm able

 

[Verse 1]
Climb
Is all we know
When thaw
Is not below us
No, can't grow up
In that iron ground
Claire, all too sore for sound

[Verse 2]
Bet
Is hardly shown
Scraped
Across the foam
Like they stole it
And, oh, how they hold it
Claire, we nearly forfeit

[Chorus 1]
I... I'm growing like the quickening hues
I... I'm telling darkness from lines on you
Over havens fora
Full and swollen morass, young habitat
All been living alone
Where the ice snap and the hold clast are known

[Verse 3]
Home
We're savage high
Come
We finally cry
Oh, and we don it
Because it's right
Claire, I was too sore for sight

[Chorus 2]
I... we're sewing up through the latchet greens
I... un-peel keenness, honey, bean for bean
Same white pillar tone as with the bone street
Sand is thrown where she stashed us at
All been living alone (All been living alone)
Where the cracks at in the low part of the stoning

[Outro]
Enough of this
Give us the grown
Give us the grown

 

[Verse 1]
For the love, Iʼd fallen on
In the swampy August dawn
What a mischief you would bring, young darling
When the onus is not all your own
When you’re up for it before you've grown
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
From the faun forever gone
In the towers of your honeycomb
I’d a tore your hair out just to climb back, darling
When you’re filling out your only form
Can you tell that itʼs just ceremon’?
Now you've added up to what you’re from
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Build your tether rain-out from your fragments
Break the sailor’s table on your sacrum
Fuck the fiercest fables, I’m with Hagen

[Verse 3]
For the love, comes the burning young
From the liver, sweating through your tongue
Well, youʼre standing on my sternum
Don’t you climb down, darling
Oh, the sermons are the first to rest
Smoke on Sundays when youʼre drunk and dressed
Out the hollows where the swallow nests
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

 

[Verse 1]
Bike down
Down to the downtown
Down to the lock down
Boards, nails lie around

[Chorus]
I crouch like a crow
Contrasting the snow
For the agony, I'd rather know
Cause blinded
I am blindsided

[Verse 2]
Peek in
Into the peer in
I'm not really like this
I'm probably plight-less

[Chorus]
I cup the window
I'm crippled and slow
For the agony, I'd rather know
Cause blinded
I am blindsided

[Bridge]
Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out? (For me now)
Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out? (For me now)
Would you really rush out? (For me now)
Would you really rush out? (For me now)
Would you really rush out? (For me now)
Ooh, ooh (For me now)
Ooh, ooh (For me now)

[Verse 3]
Taught line
Down to the shoreline
The end of a blood line
The moon is a cold light

[Chorus]
There's a pull to the flow
My feet melt the snow
For the irony, I'd rather know
Cause blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided

 

[Verse 1]
Sold my cold knot
A heavy stone
Sold my red horse for a venture home
To vanish on the bow
Settling slow
Fit it all, fit it in the doldrums
Or so the story goes
Color the era
Film it is historical
Ahh, ahh, ahh

[Verse 2]
My mile could not
Pump the plumb
In my arbor 'til my ardor trumped
Every inner inertia, lump sum
All at once
Rushing from the sub-pump
Or so the story goes
Balance we won't know
We will see when it gets warm
Ahh, ahh, ahh

 

Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry from what you won't ever find

Don't let it fool you
Don't let it fool you
Down
Dancing round, folds in the gown

Sea and the rock below
Cocked to the undertow
Bones blood and teeth erode, they will be crashing low

Wings wouldn't help you
Wings wouldn't help you
Down
Down towards the ground, gravity smiled

You barely are blinking
Wagging your face around
When'd this just become a mortal home?

Won't, won't, won't, won't
Won't let you talk me
Won't let you talk me
Down
Will pull it taut, nothing let out

 

.....ot dias yletinifed ew dnA

Now I'm more
Than I am when we started

Benefolance

I'm not sinking — I'm not synching

Five lane divers

(I'ma take it in)
(I'ma take it in)

The math ahead
The math behind it
It's moon water

The math ahead
The math behind
Moon water

Rememorize numb
And half the hum
For moon water

I'd hide Berlin
To run and find it
Moon water

The path ahead
The path behind it
It's moon water

Now I'm more
Than I am when we started

Benefolance

I'm not sinking — I'm not synching

Five lane divers

Now I'm more
Than I am when we started

 

[Verse 1]
I was unafraid, I was a boy, I was a tender age
Melic in the naked, knew a lake and drew the lofts for page
Hurdle all the waitings up, I know it wasn't wedded love, why?
Four long minutes end and it was over, it'd all be back
And the frost took up the eyes

[Verse 2]
Pressed against the pane
Could see the veins and there was poison out
Resting in a raze, the inner claims I hadn't breadth to shake
Searching for an inner clout, may not take another bout, why?
Honey in the hale could fill the pales of loving less with vain
Hon', it wasn't yet the spring

[Verse 3]
Aiming and it sunk and we were drunk and we had fleshed it out
Nose up in the globes, you never know if you are passing out
No, it wasn't maiden-up, the falling or the faded luck, why?
Hung up in the ivory, both were climbing for a finer cause
Love can hardly leave the room
With your heart

 

[Verse 1]
Don't you cherish me to sleep, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Never keep your eyelids clipped
Hold me for the pops and clicks
I was only for the father's crib

[Verse 2]
Hair, old, long along
Your neck onto your shoulder blades, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Always keep that message taped
Cross your breasts you won't erase
I was only for your very space

[Verse 3]
Hip, under nothing
Propped up by your other one, face 'way from the sun
Just have to keep a dialogue
Teach our bodies: haunt the cause
I was only trying to spell a loss

[Verse 4]
Joy, it's all founded
Pincher with the skin inside, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You pinned me with your black sphere eyes
You know that all the rope's untied
I was only for to die beside

[Bridge]
So it’s storming on the lake
Little waves our bodies break
There's a fire going out
But there's really nothing to the south
Swollen orange and light let through
Your one-piece swimmer stuck to you

[Verse 5]
Sold, I'm ever
Open ears and open eyes, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Wake up to your starboard bride
Who goes in and then stays inside
Oh, the demons come, they can subside

[Voicemail Outro]
"...really great. Sorry, I like, really don’t want to be with people right now. I can’t really do it"

 

[Verse]
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time

 

When you're out
Tell your lucky one, to know that you'll leave
Don't you lock when you're fleeing
I'd like not to hear keys

Only hold till your coffee warms
But don't hurry and speed

Once a time put a tongue, in your ear on the beach
And you clutched clicking heels

[Instrumental Outro]

 

[Verse 1]
Armour let it through
Borne the arboretic truth you kept posing
Sat down in the suit
Fixed on up, it wasn’t you by finished closing
Ramble in the roots
Had the marvel, moved the proof be kneeled fine’s glowing
Storing up the clues
It had its sullen blue bruised through by showing
Settle past a patience
Where wishes and your will are spilling pictures
Water’s running through
In the valley where we grew to write this this scripture

[Chorus]
Never gonna break, never gonna break
Never gonna break, never gonna break
Not for a part in any gamut of the dark

[Verse 2]
Doubled in the toes
Annex it, it minute closed in the morning
Did not lose it in the stack’s stow
I'mma lay that call back on ya
You know it won’t beseech you
We’re laying in an open field
I will let you grow
No need to know this
So carry on, my dear
What is clear up in the daylight is we’re hung here
Fall is coming soon
A new year for the moon and the Hmong here

[Chorus]
Never gonna break, never gonna break
Never gonna break, never gonna break
All that it seems
Bellows tracing through the streams
Never gonna break, never gonna break
Never gonna break, never gonna break
All at its seams
Swallows swelling for the beams

 

[Intro]
Fall in
Fall out
Fall along

[Verse 1]
In the first of light
Past the Noachide
Bodies wrapped in white
Stranded every pain
Baby, pasts are slain
"I got outta La Grange"

[Verse 2]
In Hinnom
All this time
With your heart in mind
Didn't you edit?
In Hinnom
Go, the least
And the precious feast
The in-vetted

[Verse 3]
Sand, it starts to steal
Dirt and ice imbed in cheeks
In the potter's field
(Solar peace
Well, it swirls and sweeps
You just set it)
Strangers scattering
Nether passage in the wind
Off pennant tension ring
(Armor, down
On the wettest ground
Not to vet it)

 

Fe, fever rest
Fever rest
(Wild heart, wild heart)
I cut you in
Deafening
Fever rest
(Darling didn't love right)
I been sleeping in a stable, mate
Not gonna do you no favors
What I got is seen you trying
Or take it down the old lanes around
Fuckified
Darling don't make love
Fight it
Love, don't fight it
Love, don't fight it
Love...
Well I'll wrap you up
And I take it by the touch
Darling don't a failure fright
Times the raker
And I'll rack it up
I'm unorphaned in our northern lights
Dedicoding every daemon
Taken in the tall grass of the mountain cable
And I cannot seem to find I'm able
A deeper, wider world
What a deep…
I'll wrap you up
Higher
Higher and higher

 

[Verse 1]
You ride in the park and you're peaking
Piss pools in your seat
She's standing inside but you surely repeat
Oh, God, don't leave me here, I will freeze 'til the end
Love is love's reprieve

[Verse 2]
Winter is coming and you're stuck here
Oh, and so is she
Now when the wind blows, you cover your teeth
And I told you to shed away and trade in your blues
Love is love's sad news

[Chorus]
That was Wisconsin, that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go, I take another place with me
Love is love's mystique

[Verse 3]
You're up on the bar and you're shaking
With every grimy word
Who will love? What's love when you've hurt?
Oh, you wonder as you see the snow kissed the curb
Love is love's return

[Chorus]
That was Wisconsin, that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go, I take another place with me
Love is love's critique

 

[Instrumental]

 

[Instrumental]

 

[Verse 1]
(It might be over soon, two, two)
(It might be over soon)
Where you gonna look for confirmation?
And if it's ever gonna happen
So as I'm standing at the station
It might be over soon

[Verse 2]
(All these years)
There I find you marked in constellation (two, two)
There isn't ceiling in our garden
And then I draw an ear on you
So I can speak into the silence
It might be over soon, two, do, two
(It might be over soon) Do, two

[Verse 3]
(And I'm gonna shout all my trouble over)
Oh and I have carried consecration
And then you expelled all decision
As I may stand up with a vision
Caught daylight, god damn right
Within a rise, there lies a scission
(It might be over soon)

 

[Verse 1]
Cobbled to your trail
Bevel through the speech
In the harbors I was hanging on
Cradled wrought and weak
Hardly aching for your drum
I'll be able when you're airborne

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Peddle all the marble
Tell them all, "Be missing me"
Fought from the mainstay
Unhung from a halter
I am back from Baltic, now
It's been raining

[Chorus]
Now I'm having
You are haven, dear

[Verse 2]
Pond in north face eyes
Center's sable
Just like cinders in a prairie fire

Pave in the broad charring up the tall trees mawde'em
Well it's maple for their deputy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Got another novel
And I'd wash down ravines
You're my main in

How that you have altered
Sure is to some fine degree
It's not careening

[Chorus]
I am having
You are haven, dear

(I am having
You are haven, dear)

 

An easy swing had it's time shouldered
-slow bending axe
Now it's a photo framed
The swing hasn't had it

And here we are rebuilding roads
Right by roosting towns
It's just like the love
-the one that's never been enough

So I'm counting on your fingers
Cause you've reattached the twitch
And if you (go) want opinion
I will die along the ditches

And every summer is a hot token
To the cold, cold take of lust
And every autumn singes
With the business of sadness

Fred had it wrong, Macy
Honey hadn't burned
Another curve in the counting
Is never served

So I'm counting on your fingers
Cause you've reattached the twitch
And if you (go) want opinion
I will die along the ditches

 

Summer comes
To multiply
To multiply!

Summer comes
To multiply
To multiply!

And I...
I'm the Carnival of Peace
I'll probably start a fleet
With no apologies

And the Carnival of Scenes...
It grows more and more appealing
But my woman and I...
My woman and I know what we're for

Summer comes
To multiply
To multiply!

Summer comes
To multiply
To multiply!

 

I've never been so high
I've never been so high
I've never been so high
I think I'm coming down

I've never laughed so loud
I've never laughed so loud
I've never laughed so loud
I think I'm coming down

Nothing gonna stop me now
Nothing gonna stop me now
Nothing gonna stop me now

Please don't leave
Easy feeling
Don't leave me like that
Not yet
Don't set me free
Free

I've never been so high
I've never been so high
I've never been so high
I think I'm coming down

I've never laughed so loud
I've never laughed so loud
I've never laughed so loud
I think I'm coming down

Nothing gonna stop me now
Nothing gonna stop me now

 

[Bon Iver]
Talk back, talk back with 'em
With your full rebound
I ain’t nothing with such cautious time
The buzzards all over now
It all ain't nothing if you don't survive
Do I need power?
Do you need power?

 

[Verse 1]
The wretched desert takes its form
The jackal proud and tight
In search of you I feel my way
Through slowest heaving night
Whatever fear invents
I swear it makes no sense
I reach out through the border fence
Come down, come talk to me

[Verse 2]
In the swirling curling storm of desire
Unuttered words hold fast
With reptile tongue, the lightning lashes
Towers built to last
Darkness creeps in like a thief
And offers no relief
Why are you shaking like a leaf?
Come on, come talk to me

[Chorus 1]
Oh please talk to me
Won't you please talk to me
We can unlock this misery
Come on, come talk to me
I did not come to steal
This all is so unreal
Can't you show me how you feel?
Now come on, come talk to me
Come talk to me
Come talk to me

[Verse 3]
The earthly power sucks shadowed milk
From sleepy tears undone
From nippled skin as smooth as silk
The bugles blow as one
You lie there with your eyes half closed
Like there's no-one there at all
There's a tension pulling on your face
Come on, come talk to me

[Chorus 2]
Won't you please talk to me?
If you'd just talk to me
Unblock this misery
If you'd only talk to me
Don't you ever change your mind
Now your future's so defined
And you act so deaf, so blind
Come on, come talk to me
Come talk to me
Come talk to me

[Bridge]
I can imagine the moment
Breaking out through the silence
All the things that we both might say
And the heart, it will not be denied
'Til we're both on the same damn side
All the barriers blown away

[Chorus 3]
I said please talk to me
Won't you please come talk to me?
Just like it used to be
Come on, come talk to me
I did not come to steal
This all is so unreal
Can you show me how you feel?
Now come on, come talk to me
Come talk to me
Come talk to me

 

[Verse 1]
Well your daddy's steering
Down your driveway in the rain
And your mom's hair is in a bun
And it's your graduation day
And your flask is hidden in your sock
You were always proud to show your moxie, babe

[Verse 2]
Well the rain is clearing up
And the baseball field is dry
And the chairs are in their rows
And some moms' eyes they start to cry
And is this my fleeting chance?
And I wonder as I gasp at all the faces made

[Chorus]
Norma Jean, show me what you drink
For fifteen years I've wondered if you know what I think
Every year another mansion goes up on the lake
And my heart it always breaks
And I keep filling up with just this one thing to say

[Verse 3]
And I'm starting to remember
Every summer day
That long night out at Charlie's
And that time when we tried cocaine
Well my heart has murmured long enough
It is time to show you that I'm tougher, babe

[Chorus]
Norma Jean, what'd you have to drink?
For fifteen years we grew up, just around from the ice rink
Now I'm watching you from across the room
Sleeping on your cap and gown
Only to chase away the doubt
And Norma, in my dreams we are the champions of this town

[Outro]
Woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo

 

[Verse]
All along I can hear it
I'm over the dash
And I'm having a bad toke
And the concrete's very slow
All along the sideline's bigger
I go for the cast
I fall off a bass boat
And the concrete's very slow
And the concrete's very slow
All along I can hear it

[Chorus]
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying

[Verse]
All along I can hear it
I'm over the dash
I'm having a bad, bad toke
And the concrete's very slow
All along the sideline's bigger
I go for the cast
I fall off a bass boat
And the concrete's very slow
And the concrete's very slow
All along I can hear it

[Chorus]
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying

[Outro]
I can hear cry

 

My heart's in the ice house come hill or come valley
Like a long ago sunday when I walked through the alley
On a cold winter's morning to a church house
Just to shovel some snow
I heard sirens on the train track howl naked gettin' nuder
An altar boy's been hit by a local commuter
Just from walking with his back turned
To the train that was coming so slow
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder
Throw your hands in the air, say "what does it matter?"
But it don't do no good to get angry
So help me I know
For a heart strained in anger grows weak and grows bitter
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own
Chain of sorrow
I been brought down to zero, pulled out and put back there
I sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with black hair
And my head shouted down to my heart
"You better look out below!"
Hey, it ain't such a long drop don't stammer don't stutter
From the diamonds in the sidewalk to the dirt in the gutter
And you carry those bruises to remind you wherever you go
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder
Throw your hands in the air, say "what does it matter?"
But it don't do no good to get angry
So help me I know
For a heart strained in anger grows weak and grows bitter
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own
Chain of sorrow

 

Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I want to say
You know I like my girls a little bit older
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I ain't got many friends left to talk to
No one's around when I'm in trouble
You know I would do anything for you
Stay the night, we'll keep it under cover
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Try to stop my hands from shakin'
Somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we've been all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'
So as you leave me please would you close the door
Don't forget what I told you
Just cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I don't wanna, I don't wanna lose
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna use
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

 

(When we leave this room it's gone)
La compañía lo posterga?
Teníamos lo que queríamos: tus ojos
(When we leave this room it's gone)
Sin saber del previo
Sería tan feliz, si te quedaras a tomar té
(I know so well that this is all there is)
Así es como crecemos ahora, mujer
Un niño ignorado
Estos serán los lugares para mí ahora
El capataz ha caído
(When we leave this room it's gone)
Estamos alzando las escaleras

ENCUENTRO A DIOS
Y A LAS RELIGIONES, TAMBIÉN...

Hospedado en el Ace Hotel
Si la calma lo permite
Entonces estaría flotando hacia ti ahora
Tendria que dejarlo pasar para poderlo pasar
Estoy escalando la consola, esa piel

(mierda de pájaro)_

(Here in this room, this narrow room where life began when we were young last night)

Bueno caminamos hacia ese flecha en la calle
Después de atarme en la entrada del departamento de su bede
Mandaste a tu hermana a casa en un taxi
Dijiste hubiera caminado a través de miles de tierras
(No, no realmente si no puedes)
No te necesitaba esa noche
No te necesito en ningún momento
Iba a tomarlo como fuera
Podría seguir adelante en la luz
Bueno, más vale doblar mi ropa

(I’ll be looking through your eyes)
All my goodness
(I’ll be looking through your eyes)
(I’ll be looking through your eyes)
All my goodness to show
(Why are you so far from saving me?)
(Why are you so far from saving me?)

 

Errant heat to the star
And the rain let in
The hawser rolls, the vessel's whole
And Christ, it's thin

Well I'd know that you'd offer
Would reveal it, though it's soft and flat
Won't repeat it, cull and coffer's that
For the soffit, hang this homeward
Pry it open with your love
Sending lost and alone standing offers

It is steep / it is stone
Such recovery
From the daily press
The deepest nest
In keeper's keep

All the news at the door
Such a revelry
Well, it's hocked inside
Of everything you said to me

It was found what we orphaned
Didn't mention it would serve us picked
Said your love is known
I'm standing up on it

Aren't we married?!
I ain't living in the dark no more
It's not a promise
I'm just gonna call it

Heavy mitted love

Our love is a star
Sure some hazardry
For the light before
And after most indefinitely

Danger has been stole away
...

This is axiom

 

De, descanso de fiebre
Descanso de fiebre
(Corazón salvaje, corazón salvaje)
Te hago una herida
Ensordecedora
Descanso de fiebre
(Corazón salvaje)
Hermano, he estado durmiendo en un establo
No te haré ningún favor
Lo que tengo es haberte visto intentándolo
O dándole vueltas por los viejos caminos
Petrificado
Cariño no hagas que el amor luche
Amor, no luches más
Amor, no luches más
Amor...
Te voy a abrazar
Déjate tocar
No le tengas pánico a fracasar
Con un rastrillo
Voy a juntar el pasado
No soy huérfano en nuestras luces del norte
Descondificando demonios ando
Como subir la cima de una montaña en medio de un pasto muy alto
No creo que lograr semejante hazaña

 

[Verso 1]
Compartiendo humo
En la escalera de la concesionaria calurosa de autos
El sol brilla fuerte sobreel spot de video
Hm, mm, mm, mm
Seguro como cualquier sueño viviente
No todo es entonces lo que parece
Y toda la cosa es retirada

[Coro 1]
Un vientre
Una bata vacía
Suficiente
Estás enrollándola
Estás deteniéndola
Eres tela ahora

Paramind
Paramind

[Verso 2]
Alucinando a Claire
Ni la luz del zapato de nieve o los otoños


Lanzó el significado por la puerta
(Ahora podrías ser una amistad)


Ya no hay significado
(Ven y bésame aquí otra vez)

[Coro 2]
Un vientre
Una bata vacía
Suficiente
Estás enrollándola
Estás reteniendo
Eres un premio doblado

Canoniza
Canoniza

[Puente]
Pon en marcha el motor y sí, por tu cuenta, ooh
Y sí, estás por tu cuenta

(La marihuana te tiene hablando...)

[Verso 3]
Dobla el mapa y repara la brecha
Y yo remolco la palabra compañía
Y me hago escapar
Oh, la multitud de otro
Siempre viene fuera de página

[Coro 3]
Sostengo la nota
Que escribiste y sé
Que has enterrado tus mariposas de pensión alimenticia

[Post-Coro]
Sub encuentra
Alguna noche

 

[Verse 1]
His embrace, a fortress
It fuels me and places
A skeleton of trust
Right beneath us
Bone by bone
Stone by stone

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
Who is it? Who is it?

[Chorus]
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over, handing it over
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over, handing it over

[Verse 2]
He demands a closeness
We all have earned a lightness
Carrying my joy on the left
Carrying my pain on the right

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If you ask yourself now, patiently now carefully:
Who is it?

[Chorus]
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over, handing it over
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over, handing it over

[Chorus]
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over, handing it over
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over, handing it over

 

Han de haber sido fuerzas, que me llevaron en esos rumbos salvajes
Quién sabe cuántas poses, en las que he estado
Pero ellas las principales más cercanas, hark! da significado Mio
Realmente no puedo publicar esto, AH siento las señales
Me preocupaba por la lluvia y por los rayos
Pero los vi irse, a la luz de la mañana
Marcando la pendiente, arrojando en las tierras altas
'Donde los días no tienen números'
Si ha lastimado, me ha lastimado, lastimará, lo dejé entrar

Oh, el viejo modus: afuera lideando con la vida
Dijo, viene en viejos ponens renunciar a luchar
Palabra sobre Gnosis: no va a hacer las compras
O insectos del centro a afuera, o pesar para econtrar
Me apuro por la pena, y me preocupo por un camino desgastado
Y me voy, sólo para volver a casa
Volteando al waltz, agárrate alto en las tierras bajas
¡Porque los días no tienen número'
Me lastima, me lastima, me lastima como un cordero

Así que puedo atestiguar esto, parcial a las enredaderas sangrando
Supongo que no aguantas ni mierda. que tan drogado he estado
Qué río que no sé es: escalar y acatar una línea
Alentar entre rosas, o quedarse atrás

He estado en esa arboled
Donde no importa el origen
Y lo caminé: cuánto duraría
Soportar dolor en el anillo, toda la banda en el cañón
'Cuando los días no tienen números'
Bueno, me lastima me lastima me lastima, lo dejaré entrar

 

[Verso 1]
Abajo a lo largo del arroyo
Recuerdo algo
Ella, la garza se fue apresuradamente
Cuando primero entre en peligro el domingo pasado (Ooh)
Luna baja señor de la calle amarilla
Recuerdo algo
Que irse no colmaba toda esa náusea en mis enredaderas
Y tan cierto es de noche como AHORA no es el momento (Oooh)

[Verso 2]
Forcejeando con tu sangre
Recuerdo algo
En B, besos no racionados en una antepenúltima noche
Encontrando ambas de tus manos mientras un segundo sol vino tras el vidrio
Y oh, sé que se sintió bien y te tuve a mi alcance

[Verso 3]
Oh y ahora, ¿cómo vamos a llorar?
Porque una vez podría no significar algo?
Amor, un segundo vistazo
No es algo que necesitaremos
Cariño, entiende que me han dejado aquí en los juncos
Pero todo lo que trato de hacer es sacar mi pies del pliegue

[Outro]
Y te veré
Voltea, eres mi equipo A
Voltea, ahora eres mi equipo A
Maldita sea, voltea ahora
Eres mi equipo A

 

"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend, it's on it's head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

…and at once I knew I was not magnificent
Strayed above the highway aisle
(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles

3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

…and at once I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
(Jagged, vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory:

…and at once I knew I was not magnificent
High above the highway aisle
(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles

 

I'm tearing up, across your face
Move dust through the light
To fide your name
It's something faint
This is not a place
Not yet awake, I'll raise the blade

Still alive for you, love
Still alive for you, love
Still alive for you, love

In a mother out a moth
Furled forests, for the soft
Gotta know been lead aloft
So I'm ridding all your stories
What I know, what it is, it's pouring wire it up!
You're breaking your ground

 

All along I can hear ya
I'm over the dash
And I'm having a bad toke
And the concrete's very slow
All along the sideline's bigger
I go for the cast
I fall off a bass boat
And the concrete's very slow
And the concrete's very slow

All along I can hear it
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying

All along I can hear it
I'm over the dash
I'm having a bad, bad toke
And the concrete's very slow
All along the sideline's bigger
I go for the cast
I fall off a bass boat
And the concrete's very slow
And the concrete's very slow

All along I can hear it
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying

 

Errant heat to the star
And the rain let in
The hawser rolls, the vessel's whole
And Christ, it's thin

Well I'd know that you'd offer
Would reveal it, though it's soft and flat
Won't repeat it, cull and coffer's that
For the soffit, hang this homeward
Pry it open with your love
Sending lost and alone standing offers

It is steep / it is stone
Such recovery
From the daily press
The deepest nest
In keeper's keep

All the news at the door
Such a revelry
Well, it's hocked inside
Of everything you said to me

It was found what we orphaned
Didn't mention it would serve us picked
Said your love is known
I'm standing up on it

Aren't we married?!
I ain't living in the dark no more
It's not a promise
I'm just gonna call it

Heavy mitted love

Our love is a star
Sure some hazardry
For the light before
And after most indefinitely

Danger has been stole away
...

This is axiom

 

South of the lake
Of a tall rider
In the mist of the cape
Where there's seldom any hiding
Barely hold out your arms
Barely hold out your arms
I need a diver
I'm not going it alone

I was a storm
A sore loser
I passed the shore
Of a sail-gone bruiser
I believe in your mind
I've already been through your allusions
So, step on into the light

Well, I'm telling you you're grown

And if there's tasks for me
Time will let it be known
And if you'd halve with me
And say pass on the long nights
Then I'd be first to see
What may not always be shown
God bless our long nights
And our light is that sky
Who I have is who I carry on

Don't wanna leave you alone
I wanna leave you alone
I cannot leave you alone
I'll never leave you alone

And if there's tasks for me
Time will let it be known
And if you'd halve with me
And say pass on the long nights
Then I'd be first to see
What may not always be shown
God bless our long nights
And our love is in the sky
Who I have is who I carry on

Well, I'm telling you you're wrong!

 

For the love, I'd fallen on
In the swampy August dawn
What a mischief you would bring young darling!
When the onus is not all your own
When you're up for it before you've grown

From the faun forever gone
In the towers of your honeycomb
I'd a tore your hair out just to climb back darling
When you're filling out your only form
Can you tell that it's just ceremon'
Now you've added up to what you're from

Build your tether rain-out from your fragments…
Break the sailor's table on your sacrum…
Fuck the fiercest fables, I'm with Hagen

For the love, comes the burning young
From the liver, sweating through your tongue
Well, you're standing on my sternum don't you climb down darling
Oh the sermons are the first to rest
Smoke on Sundays when you're drunk and dressed
Out the hollows where the swallow nests

 

I was unafraid, I was a boy, I was a tender age
Melic in the naked, knew a lake and drew the lofts for page
Hurdle all the waitings up, know it wasn't wedded love
4 long minutes end and it was over it'd all be back
And the frost took up the eyes

Pressed against the pane could see the veins and there was poison out
Resting in a raze the inner claims I hadn't breadth to shake
Searching for an inner clout, may not take another bout
Honey in the hale could fill the pales of loving less with vain
Hon, it wasn't yet the spring

Aiming and it sunk and we were drunk and we had fleshed it out
Nose up in the globes, you never know if you are passing out
No it wasn't maiden-up, the falling or the faded luck
Hung up in the ivory, both were climbing for a finer cause
Love can hardly leave the room with your heart

 

Climb
Is all we know
When thaw
Is not below us
No, can't grow up
In that iron ground
Claire, all too sore for sound

Bet
Is hardly shown
Scraped
Across the foam
Like they stole it
And oh, how they hold it
Claire, we nearly forfeit

I… I'm growing like the quickening hues
I… I'm telling darkness from lines on you
Over havens fora full and swollen morass, young habitat!
All been living alone, where the ice snap and the hold clast are known

Home
We're savage high
Come
We finally cry
Oh and we don it
Because it's right
Claire, I was too sore for sight

I… we're sewing up through the latchet greens
I… un-peel keenness, honey, bean for bean
Same white pillar tone as with the bone street sand is thrown where she stashed us at
All been living alone, where the cracks at in the low part of the stoning

Enough of this...
Give us the grown
Give us the grown

Bueno he sido tallado en fuego
Bueno he estado atrapado en fuego
He estado atrapado en fuego, whaaaa
Bueno he estado atrapado en fuego
He sido tallado en fuego
He estado atrapado en fuego
Lo que viene antes

De estar atrapado en un fuego
Me mantuve abajo la otra noche
He estado atrapado en fuego
Me mantuve abajo
(Sin saber cuál es la verdad)
He estado atrapado en fuego
Me mantuve abajo la otra noche
(Conductores de 5 carriles)
He estado atrapado en fuego
Me mantuve abajo
(Sin saber cuál es la verdad)

Fuego
(Fuego)

 

"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend, it's on it's head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

…and at once I knew I was not magnificent
Strayed above the highway aisle
(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles

3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

…and at once I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
(Jagged, vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory:

…and at once I knew I was not magnificent
High above the highway aisle
(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles

 

Don't you cherish me to sleep
Never keep your eyelids clipped
Hold me for the pops and clicks
I was only for the father's crib

Hair, old, long along
Your neck onto your shoulder blades
Always keep that message taped
Cross your breasts you won't erase
I was only for your very space

Hip, under nothing
Propped up by your other one
Face away from the sun
Just have to keep a dialogue
Teach our bodies, haunt the cause
I was only trying to spell a loss

Joy, it's all founded
Pincher with the skin inside
You pinned me with your black sphere eyes
You know that all the rope's untied
I was only for to die beside

So it's storming on the lake
Little waves our bodies break

There's a fire going out
But there's really nothing to the south

Swollen orange and light let through
Your one piece swimmer stuck to you

Sold, I'm ever
Open ears and open eyes
Wake up to your starboard bride
Who goes in and then stays inside
Oh the demons come, they can subside

 

Don't you cherish me to sleep

I was only for your very space

Hip, under nothing
Propped up by your other one

[Bon Iver]
Talk back, talk back with 'em
With your full rebound
I ain't nothing with such cautious time
The buzzards all over now
It all ain't nothing if you don't survive
Do I need power?
Do you need power?

[Capo Dim]
Started from a youngin
In the hood villain always be
This is what i is, this is me
What else can i be
Ain't shit else to be, but be me
This is what i be, buzzing where i bee
You can tell me if you disagree
But fuck it dawg fuck you dog
Fuck this shit and fuck a hug
I don't need it you can keep it
Ive been through it like a bandit
Bitch i mean it, bugs moran it
So you fucking understand it
Do you need flower or
Do you need, do you need
Do you need power?
