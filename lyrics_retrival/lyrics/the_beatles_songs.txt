[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
“Let it be”
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
“Let it be”

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
And when the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on till tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

[Interlude: John Lennon]

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Come together, right now
Over me

Shoot me, shoot me
Right!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4: John Lennon]

He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good-lookin' 'cause he's so hard to see

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me
Ugh!

Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah

Come together, yeah
Come together...

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

[Verse 2]
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

[Verse 1]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

 

[Verse 1]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Verse 2]
Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

[Verse 3]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

 

[Verse 1]
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying

[Verse 2]
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

[Verse 3]
Mister City, policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

[Verse 4]
Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl you let your knickers down

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

[Verse 5]
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

[Chorus]
I am the egg man (now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (a poor man, made to tame fortune's blows)
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob (good pity)

[Verse 6]
Expert textpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

[Verse 7]
Semolina pilchard, climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo good job goo goo goo good job
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo goo joob goo goo

[Outro]
Everybody's got one, everybody's got one
Umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper
“Villain, take my Purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party. Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable Villain; as duteous to the Vices of thy Mistress as badness would desire.”
“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you.”

 

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
But nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

[alarm clock rings]

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on

[Instrumental Outro]

 

[Intro]
Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 2]
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Bridge]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

[Verse 3]
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Outro]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right

 

[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

 

[Verse 1]
There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

[Verse 2]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 3]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

In my life I love you more

 

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on, across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Outro: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva

 

[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

 

[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 1]
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Chorus]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?

 

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 2]
No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a "no" will mean a "yes" but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Outro]
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

Cranberry sauce

 

[Segue: The Beatles]
Billy Shears!

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Verse 3: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Outro: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends

 

[Intro]
Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle

[Chorus]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Verse 1]
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that
You'll understand

[Chorus]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Verse 2]
I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do I'm hoping you will
Know what I mean

I love you

I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so
You'll understand

[Chorus]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Outro]
I will say the only words I know that
You'll understand, my Michelle

 

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 4]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 5]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

 

[Verse 1]
I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"

[Chorus 1]
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

[Verse 2]
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"

[Chorus 2]
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

[Verse 3]
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?

 

[Verse 1]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

[Verse 2]
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Verse 3]
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Bridge]
Full speed ahead, Mr. Parker, full speed ahead
Full speed over here, sir
Action station, action station
Aye, aye, sir, fire
Heaven, heaven

[Verse 4]
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need  (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (and sea of green)
In our (In our) yellow submarine (yellow submarine, ha-ha!)

[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

 

[Chorus]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

 

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oh, she does
Yeah, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oh, she do me
Yes, she does

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past (Seeking past)

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
And from the first time that she really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Outro: John Lennon]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me let down
Can you dig it? Don't let me down

 

[Intro: John Lennon]
(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Help me? Help me? Ooh

 

[Verse 1]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?

[Verse 2]
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Verse 3]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 4]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride

[Verse 5]
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Verse 6]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

[Verse 7]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away

[Verse 8]
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Outro]
Whoo!

 

[Verse 1]
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

[Verse 2]
I need a fix because I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix because I'm going down

[Verse 3]
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

[Chorus]
Happiness (is a warm gun)
Bang, bang, shoot, shoot
Happiness (is a warm gun, momma)
Bang, bang, shoot, shoot

[Verse 4]
When I hold you in my arms
And when I feel my finger on your trigger
I know nobody can do me no harm
Because:

[Chorus]
Happiness is a warm gun momma
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun
Well don't you know that happiness is a warm gun momma?

 

[Verse 1]
It was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Bridge]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

[Verse 2]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

 

[Intro]
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Verse 1]
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

[Verse 2]
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

[Verse 3]
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be. It's easy

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

[Chorus]
All you need is love (All together now)
All you need is love (Everybody)
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
(Yesterday)
(Oh yeah)
(She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yesterday)

 

[Verse 1]
Desmond has his barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

[Chorus 1]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on

[Verse 2]
Desmond takes a trolley to the jewelry store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (ring!)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (sing!)

[Chorus 1]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on

[Chorus 2]
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha ha ha ha ha)

[Chorus 3]
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

[Chorus 1]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on

[Chorus 2]
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha ha ha ha ha)

[Chorus 3]
Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band

[Chorus 1]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on

[Outro]
And if you want some fun
Take Ob-La-Di-la-da

 

[Verse 1]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Verse 3]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Outro]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

 

[Incomprehensible]

[Verse 1]
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Verse 2]
Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Chorus]
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind

[Guitar Solo: Paul McCartney]

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Chorus]
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind

[Verse 3]
Show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

 

[Verse 1]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I’ll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I’ll never do you no harm

[Verse 2]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I’ll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don’t ever leave me alone

[Chorus]
When you told me you didn’t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn’t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly fell down and died

[Verse 3]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I’ll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I’ll never do you no harm

[Chorus]
When you told me you didn’t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly fell down and cried
When you told me you didn’t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly fell down and died

[Verse 4]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I’ll never let you down
(Oh! Believe me darling)
Believe me when I tell you
I’ll never do you no harm

 

[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Hook]
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

[Hook]
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

[Outro]
C'mon Rocky boy
C'mon Rocky boy

 

[Intro: Ringo Starr]
I've got blisters on my fingers!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and turn
And I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer!
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Hook]
Go Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter
Yeah

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer!
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Hook]
Look out!
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter

[Bridge]
Look out!
'Cause here she comes

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop and I turn
And I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Well do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Hook]
Look out!
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Look out!
Helter skelter
She's coming down fast
Yes she is
Yes she is
Coming down fast

[Breakdown]

[Ringo]
I got blisters on my fingers!

 

[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures
Joa, oa, oa, oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be
So, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 3]
P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one."
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure he was dead

 

[Verse 1]
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

[​​Interlude]​​
Go home

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

[Electric Piano Solo]

[Verse 2]
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

[​​Interlude]
Hoo
Go home

[Chorus]
Oh, get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Ooo

[Verse 3]
(Ooo, ow)
Get back, Loretta
Your mommy's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back home, Loretta

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Oh, get back, get back
Get back, oh yeah
Jojo

 

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know you can count me out

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We're doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

[Outro]
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

 

[Verse 1]
Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round

[Verse 2]
Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high

[Bridge]
Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

[Verse 3]
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

 

[Verse]
There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

[Pre-Chorus]
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

[Chorus]
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

[Pre-Chorus]
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

[Chorus]
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

 

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

[Drum and Guitar Solos]

[Bridge]
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love

[Verse 2]
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make

 

[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go

[Verse 4]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true...today
Came true...today
Came true... today...yes it did
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven

 

[Verse 1]
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

[Chorus 1]
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

[Chorus 2]
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see
We're all one, and life flows on within you and without you

[Sounds of Laughter]

 

[Verse 1]
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free

[Chorus]
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Verse 2]
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

[Chorus]
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye Bye)

[Bridge]
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

[Chorus]
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years (Bye Bye)
She's leaving home Bye, bye

 

[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before it always leads me here
Leads me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting), lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

 

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh yeah, I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh please, say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
I'll let me hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I feel that something
I want to hold your hand

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

 

[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

[Verse 2]
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

[Verse 3]
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 4]
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

[Verse 5]
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

[Verse 6]
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

[Verse 7]
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning

 

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number

[Verse 1]
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

[Verse 2]
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

[Chorus]

Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
Right!
Right!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen

I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

[Chorus]

With the situation

They are standing still

The plan, the telegram

Ooh ooh

[Chorus]

Ooh

[Verse 4]
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

Alright!

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

[Verse 6]
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

[Chorus]

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El dorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

[Verse 7]
Maybe even then
Impervious in London
Could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked

If you became naked

 

[Verse 1]
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

[Muttered by John] [Outro]
Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?

Boy, you gotta carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Intro: Paul McCartney]
1, 2, 3, 4!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Well, she was just 17
And you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woo)

And before too long
I fell in love with her

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]

Since I saw her standing there

Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there

[Intro]
It's getting better all the time

[Verse 1]
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down
Turning me round
Filling me up with your rules

[Chorus 1]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's a little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

[Verse 2]
Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

[Chorus 1]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's a little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

[Chorus 2]
Getting so much better all the time!

[Chorus 3]
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better

[Verse 3]
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (ooh)

[Chorus 1]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's a little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

[Chorus 2]
Getting so much better all the time!

It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better

[Chorus 2]
Getting so much better all the time!

 

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 1]
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 3]
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe
We would be so happy, you and me
No-one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you

 

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
Because when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeh

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Ah!

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
So why on Earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling  you holding me tight, tight, yeh

[Verse 5: John Lennon]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright

 

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

{Bridge}

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Round and round and round and round and round

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
And he never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Oh (Round and round and round)
Oh

 

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it O.K
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you
But your soul - think!"

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 5: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Outro]

 

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Ah girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Ah girl
Girl, girl

[Bridge: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
She's the kind of girl who puts you down (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When friends are there, you feel a fool (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
(Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When you say she's looking good (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She acts as if it's understood (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Was she told when she was young that pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Ah girl
Girl, girl

[Outro: John Lennon]
Ah girl
Girl

 

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Well, shake it up, baby, now (Shake it up, baby)
Twist and shout (Twist and shout)
C'mon C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, baby, now (Come on baby)
Come on and work it on out (Work it on out)

[Verse: John Lennon]
Well, work it on out, honey (Work it on out)
You know you look so good (Look so good)
You know you got me goin', now (Got me goin')
Just like I knew you would (Like I knew you would)

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Well, shake it up, baby, now (Shake it up, baby)
Twist and shout (Twist and shout)
C'mon C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, baby, now (Come on baby)

And let me know that you're mine (Let me know you're mine)

Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now (Shake it up baby)

 

[Intro]
To lead a better life I need my love to be here

[Verse]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

[Bridge]
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Chorus]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

[Bridge]
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Outro]
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere

 

[Intro]
Oh, listen to that now, eheheh
Oh look out! It's-

[Verse 1]
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

[Verse 2]
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah

 

[Intro]
You say yes, I say no
You say stop and I say go go go, oh no

[Chorus]
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

I say high, you say low
You say why and I say I don't know, oh no

[Chorus]
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

Why why why why why why do you say goodbye goodbye, oh no?

[Chorus]
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

You say yes (I say yes) I say no (But I may mean no)
You say stop (I can stay) and I say go go go (Till it's time to go), oh
Oh no

[Chorus]
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

[Outro]
Hela heba helloa
Hela heba helloa, cha cha cha
Hela heba helloa, wooo
Hela heba helloa, hela
Hela heba helloa, cha cha cha
Hela heba helloa, wooo
Hela heba helloa, cha cah cah

 

[Verse 1]
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

[Verse 2]
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

[Verse 3]
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

 

[Verse 1]
The day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

[Chorus]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind her tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 2]
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[Chorus]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind her tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 3]
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

[Chorus]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind her tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

 

[Verse 1]
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her

[Verse 2]
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

[Verse 3]
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

[Verse 4]
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

 

[Intro]

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play

[Verse 2]
Dear Prudence open up your eyes
Dear Prudence see the sunny skies
The wind is low the birds will sing
That you are part of everything
Dear Prudence won't you open up your eyes?

[Bridge:  John Lennon, Jackie Lomax]
Look around round round
Look around round round
Oh look around

[Verse 3]
Dear Prudence let me see you smile
Dear Prudence like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence won't you let me see you smile?

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play

 

[Verse 1]
Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to, I will

[Verse 2]
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

[Chorus]
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

[Verse 3]
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know, I will
I will

 

[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

[Verse 2]
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse  1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

 

[Verse 1]
I told you about Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half lives

[Refrain]
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 2]
I told you about the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah

[Refrain]
Looking through a glass onion
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 3]
I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well here's another place you can be
Listen to me

[Outro]
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

[Verse 1]
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

[Chorus 2]
Nowhere Man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command

[Verse 2]
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?

[Chorus 2]
Nowhere Man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand

Nowhere Man, please listen

Nowhere Man, the world is at your command

[Chorus 1]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

[Verse 1]
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2]
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 3]
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

[Chorus]
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Outro]
We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye

 

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel alright
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no!

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Ow!

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no!

Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

 

[Chorus]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 1]
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 2]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 3]
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go

[Verse 4]
And it really doesn't matter if
I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong

[Verse 5]
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go

[Chorus]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

 

[Verse 1]
Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
That makes "The News of the World"
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
G'day!

 

[Verse 1]
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia

[Verse 2]
Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

[Verse 3]
Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out, in
Don't you know it's going to be all right
All right, all right

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution

For people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's going to be all right
All right, all right
Ah

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know

But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You aren't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's going to be all right
All right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right

Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

[Verse 2]
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man

Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try girl

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on) Come on (Come on) Come on (Come on) Come on (Come on)

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

[Verse 1]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid (Lovely Rita)
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me?

[Bridge]
Rita!

[Verse 2]
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you

[Hook]
Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid (Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Oh Lovely Rita, meter maid)

But you can do something in between

[Chorus]
Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm going to be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say

[Refrain: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you

Apologise to her

Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
She loves you
And you know you should be glad, ooh

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

[Tenor Saxophone Solo: Ronnie Scott]

(pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa)

[Bridge: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
See how they run

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

[Instrumental Break]

 

[Verse 1]
She said, I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

[Chorus 1]
I said, who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born

She said, you don't understand what I said
I said, no, no, no, you're wrong
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Chorus 2]
I said, even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
Because you're making me feel like I've never been born

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
She said, I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead

 

[Verse 1]
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

[Verse 2]
If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

[Verse 3]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

[Outro]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you

 

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

 

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 1]
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mum
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 2]

Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 3]
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

 

[Verse 1]
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

[Chorus]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 2]
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 1]
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

I dig a pony
Well, you can celebrate anything you want
Yes, you can celebrate anything you want
Oh!

I do a road hog
Well you can penetrate any place you go
Yes you can penetrate any place you go

[Chorus]
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

I pick a moon dog
Well you can radiate everything you are
Yes you can radiate everything you are

Oh now
I roll a stoney
Well you can imitate everyone you know
Yes you can imitate everyone you know

[Chorus]
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 1]
In the morning want to die
In the evening want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

Ooh girl you know the reason why

Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

 

[Verse]
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine

 

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I think I'm going to be sad
I think it's today, yeah

Is going away

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride

Is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free
When I was around

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I think I'm going to be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah

Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free
When I was around

[Bridge]
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

[Chorus]
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

[Verse 2]
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
Had you gone, you knew in time, we'd meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there

[Chorus]
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life

[Bridge]
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

[Chorus]
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

 

[Verse 1]
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

[Chorus 1]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Piano interlude]

[Verse 2]
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

[Chorus 2]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Guitar solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 3]
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone

[Chorus 3]
It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

 

[Verse 1]
Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

[Verse 2]
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

[Bridge]
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

[Verse 3]
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

[Outro]
One more time

 

[Verse 1]
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning

[Verse 2]
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning

[Verse 4]
People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet The Wife

[Verse 5]
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's OK
Good morning, good morning

 

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's right
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
No no no, oh no, oh no
Yeah yeah I've got a feeling yeah
Oh please believe me, I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah
And if you leave me I won't be late again
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Yeah yeah I've got a feeling yeah

[Hook]
I've got a feeling

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you

I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah I've got a feeling yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, (oh yeah) oh yeah, oh yeah
Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up
Everybody put their foot down
Oh yeah

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Yeah I've got a feeling
A feeling deep inside
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I've got a feeling
A feeling I can't hide
Oh no
Oh no no no
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

(Oh my soul, so hard.)

 

[Verse 1]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Chorus]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 2]
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

[Chorus]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 3]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Outro]
Yeah
Oh baby I'm changed
Ah I'm looking through you
Yeah I'm looking through you

 

[Verse 1]
You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

[Verse 2]
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me

[Bridge 1]
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be round, I'll be round

[Bridge 2]
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be round, I'll be round

[Verse 3]
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me

 

[Chorus 1]
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news

[Chorus 2]
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Verse 2]
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues

[Chorus 2]
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Verse 3]
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You're going to shout aloud

[Chorus 2]
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Verse 4]
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?

[Chorus 1]
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news

[Chorus 2]
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

 

[Chorus 1]
Martha my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation
Please, remember me
Martha my love
Don't forget me
Martha my dear

[Chorus 2]
Hold your head up you silly girl
Look what you've done!
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

[Verse]
Take a good look around you
Take a good look, you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other
Silly girl

[Chorus 2]
Hold your hand out you silly girl
See what you've done!
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

[Chorus 1]
Martha my dear
You have always been my inspiration
Please, be good to me
Martha my love
Don't forget me Martha my dear

 

[Verse 1]
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

[Chorus]
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

[Verse 2]
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

[Chorus]
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

 

[Intro]
You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care

[Verse 1]
Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?, whoa oh, oh

[Chorus]
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you

[Verse 1]
Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?, whoa oh, oh

[Chorus]
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you love to hear
I'm in love with you

[Bridge]
I've known the secret for a week or two
Nobody knows, just we two

[Verse 1]
Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?, whoa oh, oh

[Chorus]
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you love to hear
I'm in love with you

 

[Intro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer, paperback writer

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job
So I want to be a paperback writer

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer!

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
It's a dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job
But he wants to be a paperback writer

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer!
Paperback writer, paperback writer

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
It's a thousand pages, give or take a few
I'll be writing more in a week or two
I could make it longer if you like the style
I can change it 'round
And I want to be a paperback writer

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer!

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
If you really like it you can have the rights
It could make a million for you overnight
If you must return it you can send it here
But I need a break
And I want to be a paperback writer

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer!

[Outro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Paperback writer

 

[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

[Chorus: John Lennon]
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

[Verse 3: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & Ringo Starr]
Big man (Yeah)
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue

[Chorus: John Lennon]
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Wahoo woof! Woof!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!

[Speech: John Lennon]
Hey man, what's that boy?
Woof!
What do you say?
I said "woof!"
You know anymore?
Wooaah ha ha ha!
You've got it, that's it, you had it!
That's it, man, woo!
That's it! You've got it!
Don't look at me man, I only have ten children
Ah ho! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Quiet boy, quiet!
Okay
Quiet!

[Outro: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!

 

[Verse 1]
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm

[Verse 2]
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di

[Chorus]
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

[Verse 3]
I have never known the likes of this
I've been alone, and I have missed
Things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, da-da-n'da-da'n'da

[Chorus]
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

[Verse 1]
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da

[Chorus]
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

 

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1: George Harrison]
There's a fog upon L.A
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead

[Chorus: George Harrison]
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
Well it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

[Chorus: George Harrison]
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

[Verse 3: George Harrison]
Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way

[Chorus: George Harrison]
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

 

[Verse]
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmm

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

[Outro]
Good night, good night, everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night

 

[Verse 1]
It's been a long long long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you

[Verse 2]
It took a long long long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
How I love you

So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh

[Verse 3]
Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you
How I want you
Oh I love you
You know that I need you
Oh I love you

 

[Verse 1]
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

[Verse 2]
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

[Verse 3]
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

[Verse 4]
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

[Verse 5]
There's people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins you'll see

[Verse 6]
I'll make love to you
If you want me to

 

[Verse 1]
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you travelled very far?
Far as the eyes can see

[Verse 2]
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too

[Verse 3]
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby, baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby, baby you're a rich man too (fade out)

 

[Verse 1]
All through the day, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
All through the night, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine

[Verse 2]
All I can hear, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine

[Verse 2]
All I can hear, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day I me mine

 

[Verse 1]
If the rain comes
They run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes
When the sun shines
They slip into the shade
And sip their lemonade
When the sun shines
When the sun shines

[Hook]
Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

[Verse 2]
I can show you
That when it starts to rain
Everything's the same
I can show you
I can show you

[Hook]
Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

[Verse 3]
Can you hear me
That when it rains and shines
It's just a state of mind
Can you hear me
Can you hear me

[Outro]
Sdaeh rieht edih dna nur yeht semoc niar eht fI

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

[Bridge: George Harrison]
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel
So free!

Ah
Ah
Ah

[Verse 2]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Oooooo

[Outro]
Free

 

[Verse 1]
Born a poor young country boy, Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone

[Verse 2]
Sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

[Verse 3]
Find me in my field of grass, Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun

[Outro]
Mother Nature's son

 

[Intro]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better

[Verse 1]
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 2]
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 3]
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 4]
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Outro ]
Can you take me back where I came from
Can you take me back
Can you take me back where I came from
Brother, can you take me back
Can you take me back
Mm, can you take where I came from
Can you take me back

 

[Chorus 1]
One day, you'll look
To see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

[Bridge]
Some day, you'll know
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

[Chorus 3]
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus 4]
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

Yeah tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 4]

 

[Verse 1]
When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have heard enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me
You won't see me

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through my hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't have much to say
But I get turned away
And you won't see me
You won't see me

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

[Verse 3]
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
You won't see me

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

[Verse 3]
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
You won't see me

 

[Intro]
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

[Verse 1]
Treasure these few words till we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

[Verse 2]
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And till the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

[Bridge]
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

[Verse 3]
Treasure these few words till we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

[Bridge]
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

[Verse 4]
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And till the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

 

[Verse 1]
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you

[Verse 2]
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Because I won't be there with you

[Verse 3]
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you

[Outro]
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you

 

[Verse 1]
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do

[Chorus 1]
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

[Chorus 2]
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're going to say you love me too

[Verse 2]
So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more

[Chorus 1]
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

[Chorus 2]
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're going to say you love me too

[Outro]
You love me too, you love me too
You love me too

You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him
Go with him

[Verse 2]
Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know, now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him

[Verse 3]
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves my sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do

[Chorus]
Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
But let me tell you now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do ohh

[Chorus]
Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him

Go with him
You can go with him, girl
Go with him

 

[Chorus x3]
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road

 

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 1]
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good, in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 2]
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 3]
And then we lie, beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

 

[Verse 1]
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more

[Verse 2]
I hear the clock a'ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
Because you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

[Chorus x2]
Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
Because you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

[Verse 2]
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me

[Bridge]
Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore

[Verse 3]
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you

But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you

Come on and take it easy, come on and take it easy, take it easy, take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide, except for me and my monkey

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

[Verse 2]
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

[Bridge 1]
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things

[Verse 3]
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

[Bridge 2]
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand

[Verse 3]

[Outro]
I've got time
I've got time
I've got time

[Verse 1]
She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she's hit the big time
In the USA
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say

[Chorus]
Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

[Verse 2]
Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

Honey pie come back to me, oh

Yeah
I like it like that, oh ah
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, Hollywood blues

Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?

[Chorus]
Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

[Outro]
Oooooooooooh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Honey pie, honey pie

 

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (Your mother should)
Your mother should know (know)
Sing it again
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (Your mother should)

[Intro]
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Verse 1]
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

[Chorus]
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Verse 2]
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

[Chorus]

 

[Verse 1]
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Verse 2]
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Outro]
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you

Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now

You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me (please)
Hold me (squeeze)
Hold me
Hold me

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart (sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart

Uh, oh, many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself, 'cause baby, it's you (sha la la la la la la)

In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good

[Verse 1]
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me

Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read

And the only word is love
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love

[Verse 1]
That boy took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

[Verse 2]
That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

[Verse 3]
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry

[Verse 4]
This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

[Outro]
This boy
This boy
This boy

 

[Verse 1]
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
As I looked up to see your face

[Verse 2]
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

[Bridge]
If I were you, I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

[Verse 2]
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

[Outro]
No reply, no reply

[Intro]
It's all too much
It's all too much

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

[Chorus]
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

[Verse 2]
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

[Verse 3]
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
It's too much
Ah, it's too much

With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue

You're too much, ah
We all get too much

[Bridge]
Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a[x7]
Too much a

[Outro]
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much[x5]

 

[Verse 1]
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

[Chorus]
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

[Verse 2]
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

[Chorus]
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

 

[Intro]
The world is treating me bad, misery

[Verse 1]
I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad, misery

[Verse 2]
I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's going to be a drag, misery

[Bridge]
I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

[Verse 3]
Send her back to me
Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

[Bridge]
I'll remember all the little things we've done
She’ll remember and she’ll miss her only one, lonely one

[Verse 4]
Send her back to me
Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery (oh oh oh)
In misery (ooh ee ooh ooh)
My misery (la la la la la la)

 

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 1]
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 2]
I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

 

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street anymore
Oh the judge he guilty found her for robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbing Maggie Mae
This is a part of Liverpool, they returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

 

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 4]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 5]
I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I’m sitting here, doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

 

[Verse]
Cha-cha-boom!
Besame besame mucho
Each time I bring you a kiss
I hear music divine
So besame besame mucho
I love you forever
Say that you'll always be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Cha-cha-boom!
Dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings
And my life would be through
Oh besame besame mucho
Ooh I love you forever
You make all my dreams come true

[Chorus]
Ooh this joy is something new
My arms they're holding you
I never knew this thrill before
Who ever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Whispering, "It's you I adore"

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh so dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings
And my life would be through
Oh so besame besame mucho
I love you forever
Make all my dreams come true
Ooh love you for ever
Make all my dreams come true
Ooh love you for ever
Make all my dreams come true

 

[Verse 1]
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

[Chorus 1]
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

[Chorus 2]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 3]
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

[Chorus 3]
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 4]
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a Congo
So keep a rocking that piano

[Chorus 4]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

 

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

[Chorus 1]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Verse 2]
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

[Chorus]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Bridge]
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

[Verse 3]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

[Chorus]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Bridge]
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

[Verse 2]
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

[Chorus]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

 

[Verse 1: George Harrison]
Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3: George Harrison]
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two

[Verse 4: George Harrison]
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

[Verse 5: George Harrison]
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 6: George Harrison]
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

[Outro: George Harrison]
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

 

[Verse 1]
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 2]
You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 3]
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 4]
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay. And that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

 

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Verse 1]
Every night when everybody has fun
Here am I sitting all on my own

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Middle Eight]
Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home
Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day I've done nothing but cry

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Middle Eight]
Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home
So every day we'll be happy I know
Now I know that you won't leave me no more

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Verse 1]
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
If you don't take her out tonight
She's going to change her mind
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind

[Verse 2]
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
If you don't treat her right, my friend
You're going to find her gone
Cos I will treat her right, and then
You'll be the lonely one

[Chorus]
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
I'll make a point
Of taking her away from you, yeah
The way you treat her what else can I do?
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
I'll make a point
Of taking her away from you, yeah
The way you treat her what else can I do?

[Verse 3]
If you don't take her out tonight
She's going to change her mind
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind
You're going to lose that girl

[Chorus 1]
My baby says she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Chorus 2]
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, you're only fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Verse]
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

[Chorus 1]

[Verse]

[Chorus 1]

 

[Verse 1]
I’ve got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I’m going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that

Well, it’s the second time I’ve caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin
I think I'll let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that

[Chorus]
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

[Verse 2]
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!

[Bridge]
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)

[Chorus]
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

[Verse 3]
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!

 

[Verse 1]
I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

[Chorus]
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

[Verse 2]
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

[Chorus]
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Bridge]
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

[Verse 3]
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

[Chorus]
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

 

[Verse 1]
I love you, because you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know
That I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry
It's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery

[Chorus]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

[Verse 2]
I love you, because you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know
That I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

[Chorus]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery

[Chorus]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

 

[Instrumental]

 

[Intro]
A taste of honey! Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Verse 1]
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey! Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Chorus]
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you

[Verse 2]
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
That taste of honey! Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Chorus]
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back (he'll come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you

 

[Verse 1]
You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Chorus]
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

[Verse 2]
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Chorus]
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

[Outro]
I want to go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again

 

[Intro]
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Verse 1]
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
Because I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Because I'm happy just to dance with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Chorus]
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Because I'm happy just to dance with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Chorus]
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
Because I'm happy just to dance with you

 

[Verse 1]
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you."

[Verse 3]
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There will be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

[Verse 4]
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

 

[Verse 1: George Harrison]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote it like that

[Verse 2]
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

[Verse 3]
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

[Verse 4]
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there

[Outro]
And I told you there's no one there

 

[Verse 1]
I been told when a boy kiss a girl
Take a trip around the world
Hey, hey (Bop shuop, m'bop bop shuop)
Hey, hey (Bop shuop, m'bop bop shuop)
Hey, hey, (Bop shuop) yeah, she say ya do (Bop shuop)

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Chorus]
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Verse]
I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Verse 1]

Me on my own

Where every night
I'm all alone

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-ay
But I'll come back again someday

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
And when I do you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

We will never be apart if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me

If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realise now, what you see is me

[Chorus]
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?

I've got no business being here with you

You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me

{Intro}

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

{Instrumental Bridge}

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

Though I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast

But you better hurry because it may not last

[Chorus]
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?

[Verse 3]
If you want it, here it is

Sonny, if you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you'd better hurry because it's going fast

[Verse]
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're going to do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me

[Chorus]
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

Woh yeh, oh yeh
Imagine, I'm in love with you
It's easy because I know

Many, many, many times before

[Chorus]
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah

Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah

So you might as well resign yourself to me, oh yeah

[Intro]

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets (oh) is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Ooh!

[Bridge]

Ooh!

Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, in mama's head it's got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

[Outro]

We all miss you; You miss them?
Yeah!
The Beatles miss you; all the Beatles missed you
Now, junior, behave yourself

 

{Intro}

I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sittin' here wonderin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go

I'm an ole poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I'm an ole poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I've never been happy cause everything I
Ever did was wrong

Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches honey
Please don't mess around my tree
I got news for you baby
Leave me here in misery

Allright!

{Bridge}

Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs

Well, I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go

 

[Verse]
I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

Oh I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
Aww

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

 

Standing in the garden waiting for the sun to shine
Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine
Everybody does think a thing it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some

Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Looking at the bench of next door neighbors
Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers
Everybody's got to have something hard to hold
Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
You gotta get out son and make you one

Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know
Shoot big
Shoot big

Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big
You gotta shoot big
Until you shoot big

I can't stand it

 

[Verse 1]
Oh ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?

[Verse 2]
Oh ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she nice?

[Chorus 1]
Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me, oh my
Ain't that perfection?

[Verse 3]
Oh I repeat
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Yes I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?

Oh ain't she sweet?

Ain't she sweet?

Yes I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she nice?

[Chorus 2]
Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me, oh my
Ain't that perfection?

[Verse 6]
Oh I repeat
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?

Oh ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street?
Well I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?
Well I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?

 

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see

No I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

[Chorus:]
So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Whenever you're in trouble would you stand by me?
Oh, stand by
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

[Chorus:]

[Lee Peters] Next number was called "Sha La La La La La"

[Verse 1]
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning
But it's not always going to be this grey

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away

[Verse 2]
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving
It has not always been this grey

[Chorus]

All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So I must be on my way
And face another day

[Verse 3]
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this grey

[Chorus] [x2]

 

(Aaah
Aaah
Aaah)

Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?

(Aaah
Aaah
Aaah)

 

Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad
When I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know little girl
Only a fool would doubt our love
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do (Way that you do)
That's the kind of love
That is too good to be true
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl

Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad
When I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

 

[Speech]

[Ringo] I'm Ringo and I play the drums
[Paul] I'm Paul and I play the ehm bass [Chhhh]
[George] I'm George and I play a guitar [whistle]
[John] I'm John and I too play guitar, sometimes I play the fool

 

Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people
Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away

We were talking
About the love we all could share
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

 

[Verse 1]
She looks as an African Queen
She eating twelve chapattis and cream
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
She coming from out of Bahran
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party

[Verse 2]
She like to be married with Yetti
He grooving such cookie spaghetti
She jumping as Mexican bean
To make that her body morphine
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party

[Verse 3]
She catch Patagonian pancake
With that one and gin party makes
She having always good contact
She making with Apple and contract
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
All together now
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame
Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame
Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame

What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame

She looks as an African Queen

She tastes as Mongolian lamb

[Outro]
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
All together now
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame

(That's it
Before we got taking no what)

 

[Verse 1]
You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are

[Verse 2]
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tom-boy
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to to be
As sweet as you are

[Verse 3]
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So how can I get tired of you
A lots of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to to be
As sweet as you are

[Outro]
Please don't ever change
Don't you ever change
Please don't ever change
Don't you ever change (fade out)

It was twenty years ago today

But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Chorus: John Lennon]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely

It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know

Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me
Starlight and dewdrops are awaiting thee
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day
Led by the moonlight have all passed away

Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song
List while I woo the with soft melody
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng

Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me!

Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelei
Over the streamlet vapors are borne
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn

Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart

Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

 

Wake up in the morning I don't feel blue
?Cause I know I got you
Get a funny feeling all day and night
I get the funny feeling you don't treat me right

Should have read your letters
And then I'd know
I would have felt much better
Because I know you love me so

Wake up in the morning I don't feel blue
?Cause I know I got you
Get a funny feeling all day and night
I get the funny feeling you don't treat me right

Should have read your letters
And then I'd know
I would have felt much better
Because I know you love me so

 

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]
I'm hoping everyday
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

Can you feel when I'm holding you near
All the things that I do?
So, my love, am I making it clear?
One and one is two

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]
Can't you see I've loved you from the start?
Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
From wanting you

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]
If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything is alright
All the world would look so fine
If you'll be mine tonight

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]

 

[Chorus]
Step inside love and stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay

[Verse]
You look tired, love
Let me turn down the light
Come in out of the cold
Rest your head on my shoulder
And kiss me goodnight
We are together
Now and forever, come my way

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo-Fanques Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
'ving been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

Yeah-yeah-yeah...
Yeaahhh, yeah-yeah-yeah...
Coming down fast, but I'm miles above you...
Yeaahhh...
Tell me, tell me, tell me, c'mon, tell me the answer...
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
Yeaahhh...

 

[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 3]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 4]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

 

If you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you

The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I lost my one and only
They'd be sad if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighing
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me

But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me

So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cos they know I got my one and only
They'll be glad you're not bad to me

They'll be glad you're not bad to me, to me, to me

 

[Verse 1]
Not guilty
For getting in your way, while you try to steal the day
Not guilty
I'm not nodding for the rest, I'm not trying to steal you vest
I end up trying to be smart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your aging head, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

[Verse 2]
Though you signing me a writ, while I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your hoard I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

[Verse 3]
Not guilty
For looking like a freak, making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray, on the road to Masalay
I won't upset the apple cart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been mislead, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

 

[Chorus 1]
How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you

[Verse]
How do you do what you do to me?
I'm feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue

[Chorus 2]
You give me a feeling in my heart, ooh-la-la
Like an arrow piercing through it
I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it?

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1] [x2]

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich
Gestern had ich sie gesehen
Sie denkt ja nur an dich
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen
Oh, ja sie liebt dich
Schoner kann es garnicht sein
Ja, sie liebt dich
Und da solltest du dich freuen

Du hast ihr weh getan

Oh, ja sie liebt dich
Schoner kann es garnicht sein

But you can do something in between"

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah

Ahhh

Look, what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

You got me running and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

It's so fine, it's sunshine

It's the word, love
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and I love her so
And every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I love her so

[Verse 2]
When I call her on the telephone
She says, "Baby, I'm all alone"
Before the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door

[Verse 3]
Every evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
"Hey baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I just love that chick so

 

All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do

Everything you need is here
And everything that's not here is not there
And if if there's something missing in this God almighty plan
Could it be you need a woman?

The magic in the mantra will give you the answer

And if there's something missing in this God almighty plan
Could it be you need a woman?

Well all you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do

Take three times a day after every meal

All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do

Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]

A Soldier of Love, that's hard to be

[Chorus]
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And surrender to me (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms to squeeze and please because I'm the one that loves you so

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on, across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Outro: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva

If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me (Oh oh)

You're quite contend to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just because you're trouble
Then don't bring your troubles to me

Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamond and rings (Oh oh)

Well try someone softer instead anything

On the road to Rishikesh
I was dreaming more or less
And the dream I had was true
Yes, the dream I had was true

I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just child of nature
I'm one of nature's children

Sunlight shining in your eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes, my thoughts return to home

I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one nature's children

Underneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind that never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soul

I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature's children

 

[Verse 1]
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now

[Verse 2]
Some other guy now, is sipping up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love just like I'm gone, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now

Oh oh hoho
Oh yeah! Ow! Ow!

Ow!

[Outro]
Hey! Yeah!

 

I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do
It's for you love, true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you
They said that love was a lie
Told me that I
Never should try to find
Somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you
And love comes love shows
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you

 

*Coughs*
Take 1
Hello? Hello
[?]

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Speech]
Paul: John, sing, uh... sing all those quicker, "Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, yellow and green"
John: Okay
Paul: Anyway
John: Yeah

 

[Speech]
Paul: "In the Life Of", Take 1
John: Dab the mic on the piano, and quite low, this, just keep it in like, maracas you know. You know those old pianos
John:  Okay we're on. Mouth
John: Sugarplum fairy, sugarplum fairy

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

[Interlude]
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty

[Verse 3: Instrumental]

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
Four-thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on

[Interlude]
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty

[Outro]
Umm

 

[Speech]
John: My guitar still seems to go in and out like it's--like the lead's wrong
John: I did a freak out one then, one of them where you don't know what you're doing, just a funny [?]
Paul: Keep that one
John: Alright, let's go
Paul: One, two, three, four
Paul: Et laudate, cum una voce reclamamus, non nobis solum sed toti mundo nati

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Rita!

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Lovely meter maid
Rita, meter maid
Oh Lovely Rita meter, meter maid

John: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I refuse to go

 

My Bonnie lies over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea

[Verse 1]
For goodness sake

With the hippy hippy shake

Yea the hippy hippy shake oh yeah

 

Falling in love again, for the love we share
As you hear me say "I adore you."

I'm falling in love again, oh, my darling, it seems
All my darling it seems, I love you

All our romances would never go astray
My love is your love, forever and a day

Falling in love again, paradise right here
I love that you're my dear, I love you

(Instrumental break)

Falling in love again, for the love we share
As you hear me say "I adore you."

Falling in love again, paradise right here
I love that you're my dear, I love you

 

[Speech]

[Brian Matthew] Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?
[Paul] We don't think so, really
[Brian] You don't ever think that?
[Paul] Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbing about you, which you get often
[John] Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids
[Brian] Now, what do you, eh, well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?
[John] No, she knows I'm not divorced, because I keep seeing her every day, you see
[Brian] Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, eh"
[Paul] Like riding a bus?
[Brian] Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you
[Paul] Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things
[John] We go to certain ones
[George] And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, because they pretend they don't know us
[Paul] Joe's CafAc!
[Brian] Yeah, that figures
[Paul] Joe's CafAc! Social statement, that, you know
[George] It is

 

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] [x2]

And you know that your love
Is all you've got
At times things are so fine
And at times they're not
But when she says she loves you
That means a lot

Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide
What you feel when it's real

This is the story
About a boy named Ted
If his mother said (Said)
"Ted, be good (Be good, Ted)," he would (Alright)

She told him tales
About his soldier dad
But it made her sad
Then she cried, oh my

[Pre-Chorus]
Ted used to tell her
He'd be twice as good
And he knew he could
Because in his head he said
"Mummy don't worry
Your mblmblmbl's here
Taking good care of you
Mama don't worry
Your Teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"

[Chorus]
And she said
"Teddy don't worry
Your mummy's here
Taking good care of you"
She said, "Teddy don't worry
Your mummy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"

He said, "Ta da da"

[Verse 2]
Then came the day
She found herself a man
Teddy turned and ran
Oh far away, oh yeah

He couldn't stand
Just to be around
So he left the town far away, yeah yeah

He'd be twice as good
And he knew he could
Because in his head, he said

 

[Verse]
Three cool cats
Three cool cats
Are coming up in a beat up car
Spitting up a lift of candy bar
Talking on about how sharp they are
Three cool cats

Three cool chicks
Are walking down the street
Swinging their hips
Splitting up a bag of potato chips
I think cool cats really did flip
Three cool chicks
Yeah three cool chicks

[Pre-Chorus]
Well up came that first cool cat
He said, "Man look at that
Man, do you see what I see?"
"Well I want that middle chick"
"I want that little chick"
"Hey man save once chick for me"
Hey, well three cool chicks
Three cool chicks

[Chorus]
Well they love like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
But three cool chicks
Made three fools out of three cool cats
Three cool cats

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Three cool cats
Three cool cats

(Three cool cats, oh three cool cats)

 

[Chorus]
Well, that's alright, Mama

[Instrumental]

 

If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon as you don't have long

Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there

If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there

Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there

Looking for release from limitation
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way brings results

Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there

 

[John Lennon]
He was a fool unto himself

[Paul McCartney]
Rocky Raccoon
Rocky Raccoon, he was a fool unto himself
And he would not swallow his foolish pride
Mind you, coming from a little town in Minnesota
It was not the kind of thing that a young guy did
When a fella went and stole his chick away from him

Now, Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
And Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
Said, "Danny boy this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot (gunshot sound effect)
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

The doctor walked in, sminking of gin (laughs), 'sminking'?
Proceeded to lie on the table (he was really "sminking" of gin)
And it did him in, in the end, poor doc
Meantime, back on the table, yeah
Doctor said, "Rock, you met your match, son"
Rocky said, "it's only a scratch, son
I'll be better soon, he better be, better soon, said the doc
"Come on, son
Gotta get hip, gotta get up, gotta get back till you're good
Gotta go show that Danny boy"

However, Rocky Raccoon fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

[Instrumental Outro]

That's the story of the Rocky Raccoon! (Heeyyy!)

 

[Verse 1]
[Brian Matthew] Is that it? Is that the end?
[Paul] Yeah, yeah, that's it
[John] Fade, fade!
[Brian] Good track Oh, well, we'll stop there, stop there, stop there

[Verse 2]
[John] What an end!
[Brian] Quiet! All right, George
[John] Fade!
[Brian] Hold it!
[George] Oh, thank you
[John] Fade, you silly

[Verse 3]
[Brian] Well, we did We did that Oh, no! No! We've done that bit!
[John] The train comes in now
[Brian] We did that
[John] Yeah

[Verse 4]
[Brian] To prove we weren't playing the record, then, you see 'Cause, otherwise, there's no point in you being here, is there? Ha, ha, ha!
[John] Yeah, we did that, 'cause it sounds just like it, don't it?
[Brian] Pretty cool lot of fellows, aren't you? Here, Ringo, have a banana, catch!

 

Ho!
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!)
As the slow ray round about
Deep and crisp and crispy
Brightly show the boot last night
On the mosty cruel
Henry Hall and David Lloyd
Betty Grable too-oo-oo

Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!)
We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already. But we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show. This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because "Love Me Do" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:

Garry Crimble to you
Garry Mimble to you
Getty Bable, dear Christmas
Happy Birthday me too

This is Paul here
Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like jelly babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off jelly babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing. (Yes! Yes! Oh yes!)

Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio (yes, we enjoy that very kindly) to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop, (Stop! Stop!) and Ringo, (Stop! Stop! Shouting those animals!) so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription

Ja, das wird uns danke schon
Und denn gruss von even
Ja, denn gruss von even schon
Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy
Danke schon

Ja, Ringo!

Hello, Ringo here
As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups... (Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas) Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted
(Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas)
King Wenceslas:

Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!)
On the feast of Stephen (Hey!)
When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!)
Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!)

Hooray!

Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!)
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters
And I'd just like to say:

Brightly was the shone that night
Though the winter cruel
When a pork pie came inside
Gathering winter cruel

Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!)
Had a very shiny nose (A shiny nose!)
When ev'rybody picked it...

Ha, ha, ha, ha...

Oh yeah! Oh!

Rudolph, the red nosed Ringo (Rudolph!)
Had a very shiny nose

Merry Christmas everybody!

So if we ever part and I leave you
You say you told me and you told me boldly

Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand

[Chorus 1]

I saw her standing on the corner (Yip yip boom)
A yellow ribbon in her hair (Yip yip boom)
I couldn't stop myself from calling
Well look a-there, look a-there
Wow look a-there, well look a-there
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

[Verse 2]
I took one look and I was fractured (Yip yip boom)
I tried to walk but I was lame (Yip yip boom)
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
Well what's your name, what's your name
Well what's your name, well what's your name
Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

[Verse 3]
A crazy stop, she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!

[Verse 4]
Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered (Yip yip boom)
I saw the rising of the sun (Yip yip boom)
And all along my heart was falling
While you're the one, you're the one
While you're the one, ah you're the one
Young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I met her walking down a uptown street
She's so fine you know I wished she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet

I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Yeah, I do mean you
I'm just trying to get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I tell ya now she looks so good
Got so much skills and such a beautiful will
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood

I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Come on and give me a cue
So I can get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She's sitting right here by my side
Lovely indeed that why I asked if she
Promised someday she will be my bride

Talkin' 'bout you
I do mean you
Nobody but you
Come on, let me get a message through

 

[Verse]
Well, if your hands start a-clapping
And your fingers start a-popping
And your feet start a-moving around

And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound

And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round

[Chorus 1]
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure

[Chorus 2]
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?

[Chorus 3]
Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing
And chills coming up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2]
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?

[Chorus 3]

 

As I was slowly passing
An orphan's home one day
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play
Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

No mummy's arms to hold me
Or sue me when I cry
'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome
I wish that I could die
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see

And just like for the other kids
It will be a home for me

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

When I see you
I just don't know what to say
I like to be with you
Every hour of the day
So if you want me
Just like I need you
You know what to do

I watched you walking by
And you looked alone
I hope that you won't mind
If I walk you back home
And if you want me
Just like I need you
You know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Just call on me
When you're lonely
I'll keep my love
For you only

Make you love me more
In every way

Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well blue moon of Kentucky
Just keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Well, it was on one moonlight night
With the stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said goodbye

Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining

Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

The leaves of brown
Came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun went out
Just like a light
Remember in September in the rain

To every word
Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain

Thought it's spring
To me it's still September
Oh that September in the rain

To every word
Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring
To me it's still September
Oh that September in the rain
I said I said it's September in the rain
Ah September in the rain

 

If you leave me, baby
I don't know what I´ll do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die
Oh, if you want me, baby
You've gotta come to me
Mm, I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Ooh, some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die
Well, if you want me, baby
Mm, you've gotta come to me
I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me
Well, if you want me, baby
Mm, you've gotta come to me
I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me
Well, if you leave me, baby
I don't know what I´ll do

If I don't get a kiss from you
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Mm, some god damned insurance on me, baby
If you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die

"Strawberry Fields Forever", Take 7, remix from four-track Take 6

Two, three, four

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

 

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Always know sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean, ah yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever

 

Why why can't we love again?
Why why are you shy on love?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?

Why why don't you open your heart?
Why why are we so far apart?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?

I just want your loving arms around me, yeah
I got to find a way to make you take me back

Baby won't you tell me
Why why why why are we so far apart?

Why why don't you open your heart?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?

I just want your loving arms around me, yeah
I got to find a way to make you take me back

Baby won't you tell me
Why why why why are we so far apart?
Why why don't you open your heart?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me
Why can't you love me
Why can't you love me again?

 

I tried to find out
What love is all about
And every day
It sure lets out
I see my baby
I get week in my knees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
My pappie told me
There'd be times like these
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang
And go to rocking Joes
The cats are something
On the heels and toes
I grab my baby
Tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Why must she be
Such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I beg her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some loving, baby
Please please please
Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees, yeah
She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I'm begging her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some of your loving, baby
Please please please
Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast from miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

And I know, as I get, that I'll never get high
But I set to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah

(All): (Singing)
Orowainya, orowainya, orowainya....

Yohoo! Yodellaihetee! Yohoo!

Hodellaihetee! Yodellaihetee!

(R): I'm standing in the entrance to the main tent. Immediately behind me, the festivities have already begun

(J): Tell me, are you enjoying the wine?

(P): I am indeed your Highness. It goes well with me. (*Yeh, very good very good, ha ha ha!?)

(P): The King seems to be enjoying himself tonight! (*You might not have seen him in such good focus since the October festival.?)

(J): (*Alright!?) Is there a doctor here? Is there a doctor around here? Did anybody see one?

(P): Podgy the bear and Jasper were huddled around the unlit fire in the centre of the room. "There are no more matches left, Podgy," said Jasper. "Then buy some, Jasper, old friend," said Podgy. "Make a list and afterwards we'll go to the shop and buy matches and (*buy?) candles and buns." "There's no more paper to write on, Podgy" "No need to worry, Jasper. You keep saying to yourself 'matches' and I'll keep saying 'candles' until we reach the shop. Then we won't need to write it down. We'll remember." "Who'll remember the buns, Podgy?" "We both will, Jasper ... Matches," "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles."

(J): In the long dark corridors of Felpin Mansions, a door slams and the shadowy figure of Count Balder appears. The Count is the eccentric son of Baron Lndsberg, the inventor of the rack. He speaks "Guten Tagen, meinen damen and herren. Welcome to Felpin Mansions. The butler will show you to your rooms. Butler!" "Yes, sir!" "Show the ladies and gentlemen to their rooms."

(P): Come in

(J): May I come in?

(P): Come, come in, Count!

(P): Oh, my goodness, yes. Don't you worry on that score. I hear the Baron likes, uh, I hear the Baron likes the good old tunes

(J): Yes, I do

(P): So do I, Count, so do I. But they're all melodies, aren't they?

(P): No, don't worry. I'll play this one. Do you like this one? Listen to this one

(P): (Singing)
Please don't bring your banjo bag
I know where it's been
I wasn't hardly gone a day
When it became the scene
Banjos, banjos all the time
I can't forget that tune

(All): (Singing)
And if I ever see another banjo
I'm going out to buy a big balloon
And if I ever see another banjo

[Verse 1]
We've been friends for oh so long
I let you share what's mine
When you mess with the girl I love
It's time to draw the line

[Chorus]
Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Am I going to tell you but one more time
Who, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine

[Verse 2]
I don't mind if you lend my clothes
But you will be in touch
There is something that you get straight
There's one thing you don't touch

[Chorus] [x2]

[Chorus]
(Keep your hands) Who, keep your hands off my baby
She's mine (Keep your hands off my baby)
You better watch yourself now
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine

 

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave, doo-be-doo

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Whoo!

 

[Chorus]
Oh Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

[Verse 1]
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride
Well you take your car along
And you park it outside
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am
Well every time you're going to drive
You find the joint is jammed

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well if you want to hear some music
Like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot
Don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overcome you
Because they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd
Well you can dance
I know you will, you thought
I got my eyes on you baby
Because you dance so good

Don't let him
Steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes you all night and day

 

[Chorus]
John: Take 3. Right, this
[?]
George: We'll have to try
Paul: Yeah, try and make it
Paul: Okay

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
There I will go

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
And that's right

 

[Speech: John Lennon]
We were four guys, that, eh... I met Paul, said, "Do you wanna join me band?", you know, and then George joined and then Ringo joined. We were just a band who made it very, very big, that's all

 

[Intro]
(Oh) Oh, yeah
(Oh) Oh, yeah
(Oh) Oh, yeah!
Hello, hello

[Bridge]
Nothing is real

[Verse 1]
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Instrumental Outro]

 

[Speech]
John: It is Getting Better Take 1
John: Sing it, oh, you know, "I've got to admit and" and all that, [?], if you didn't think, you know

Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
All right, hey, hey, all right now
See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
All right, hey, hey, mmm, all right now
Ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ohh
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good
Mmm, see the girl with the red dress on
She can do the dog all night long
All right, hmm what'd I say, tell me what'd I say
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say

Baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing right now
Baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing right now
Baby shake that thing, well I feel all right

 

All I've got is a picture of you
Now that you've gone and left me blue
You don't hear me cry at night
And say sweet things to you
You don't hear me sing a love song to
A picture of you

I pretend that you're still here with me
Laughing just the way we used to be
But pictures they can't talk and they can't see
I know I'm in love and nothing more
Nothing more

I hope you'll be happy where you are
But if you need me I won't be to far
Standing in the shadow of my dreams
They say it's not as bad as it may seem
But they don't lie awake at night and cry the way I do
They don't realise that all I got
Is a picture of you

 

[Intro]
I don't care if I spent my dough
Night going to be

[Verse 1]
Going to rock it up
Going to shake it up
Going to roll it up
Have them ball tonight

Rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul

Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said to my soul:
You're the devil in a frying pan

Well I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul

You can knock me down
Slap my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do
But oh oh honey
Lay off of them shoes

[Chorus]
Now don't you step
On my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes

Ah go!

[Verse 2]
You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar
Do anything
That you want to do
But ah ah honey
Lay off of them shoes

[Chorus]

Ah go, hit it, Carl!

[Verse 3]
Well blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Yeah blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Babe blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Yeah brown brown
Brown suede boots
Well do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes

 

[Verse]
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time

[Chorus] [x2]
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Because I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

 

[Verse]
Yeah
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you

I'm going to love you more and more every day
I'm going to love you more and more every day
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you

[Pre-Chorus]
Going to tell your mama
Tell your papa, too
So they'll know exactly
Just what I'm going to do

[Chorus]
If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you

Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

 

[Chorus]
Ah Lucille
Baby do your sister's will
Ah Lucille
Baby do your sister's will
Well you went up and married
But I love you still

[Verse]
Ah Lucille
Baby satisfy my soul
Ah Lucille
Baby satisfy my soul
Well you know I love baby
I'll never let you go

Babe I woke up this morning
Lucille was not inside
I asked her friends about her
But all their lips were tight

Lucille
Please come back where you belong
Well I'm talking to you baby
I'll never put you on
Aaaah! Wah!

[Chorus]

 

[Verse]
You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
But I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone

You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
This dog is going to get you
If you don't leave her alone

[Chorus]
Well Mr.Dog I'm going to hit you
On the top of your head
That child is going to miss you
You going to wish that you were dead
If you don't leave my kitten all alone
Well I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone

[Bridge]
Alright
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey hey

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah hey you better leave, you better leave
You better leave, yeah you better leave
You better leave, oh you got to leave
Hey hey, well I told you big fat bulldog

 

I need a fix cause' I'm going down
Back to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause' I'm going down

Mother Superior jumped-

Oh shit, wrong chord...
Okay

I need a fix cause' I'm going down
Back to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause' I'm going down

Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

Yoko Ono, oh no
Yoko Ono, oh yes

Back to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause' I'm going down

Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

 

John: For the benefit of Mr. Kite
John: Ice water
Paul: One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops gate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

Without Henry!
Three, four

Three, four

George Martin: Don't shout it out, though, John, just mouth it
John: Well, alright
George Martin: You'll hear it, though, I mean, it'll be on the bass
John: Well, we'll have the massed Alberts on by then, won't we? Two, three, four

 

[Verse 1]
Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
Because my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

[Verse 2]
Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge

[Verse 3]
Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

[Verse 4]
The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

 

[Verse 1]
Well, I got a baby crazy for me
Yeah, I got a baby won't let me be
Who, baby baby, Clarabella
Baby baby, Clarabella
Baby baby, wo wo, yeah uh

Well, she needs no coaching on making love

[Chorus]
Well now, Clarabella
Yeah, you're my honey, Clarabella

[Verse]
I'm sure to fall, fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet and so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you

[Pre-Chorus]
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling don't ever let me go

[Chorus]
Loving you is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour!
Step right this way!

Roll up
Roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up
Roll up for the mystery tour

The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away, take you today

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Everywhere people stare
Each and ev'ry day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!

Oho, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me to, ohohoho, oho
And when I ask you to be mine, ahaha
You're gonna say you love me too

It's been a hard days night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

Oh!

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah!
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
And she don't care

Jo-Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo-Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back!
Get back!

 

[Verse 1]
We were sailing along (Twist and shout)
On Moonlight Bay (Ooh)
We could hear the voices singing (I like it!)
They seemed to say (Keep on, Bongo)
You have broken my heart (Oh, twist and shout)
So go away

(Are the Beatles gone?
No, they're here
Oh)

[Verse 2]
With you big, far, hairy legs
On Moonlight Bay
On Moonlight Bay

[Outro]
Ooohhh
Yeah!
Ha ha!

 

(R): Hello, this is a big "Hi" and a sincere Merry Christmas from yours truly, Ringo Starr

(P): (Singing)
Happy New Year, happy Christmas
Happy Easter, happy autumn
Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody
Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you

I'd like to wish ev'rybody happy Christmas
This year of 1968 going on 69
Happy Christmas, happy New Year
All the best to you from here

Ah - haaa!

I'd like to wish ev'rybody
Happy Christmas, happy New Year
From there to here
Happy New Year, happy New Year
Happy New Year, happy New Year

When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

(J): Once upon a time, there were two balloons called
Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen
In a million years. They were together man. Unfortunate
Timetable, they seemed to have previous experience which
Kept calling them one way or another. You know how it is
But they battled on against overwhelming oddities
Including some of their beast friends. Being in love
They clung together even more man. But some of the
Poisonous monsters' outdated boss - lordy ape claws did
Stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to
The dry cleaners. Luckily, this did not kill them and
They weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived
Hopefully ever after and who could blame them?

(G): Well, here we are again, another fab Christmas. Christmas
Time is here again. Ain't been around since last year
And we'd like to take this opportunity, all the way from
America, to say happy Christmas to you our faithful
Beloved fans all over the world who have made our life
Worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who
Through thick and thin would surely like to say a word
Of greeting at this festive occasion

(M): Merry Christmas children everywhere!

(?): At the first stroke, it will be ...

(R): ... Ringo Starr. Thank you!
"Good evening."
"Hello me dear. I didn't know you were coming."
"I'm not surprised."
"Well, I am! Certainly am!"
"I would have thought so myself."
"Well, if you ask me, I think it's insane."
"Occasionally."
"Yes, me, too. Twice a week sometimes."
"Fourteen and six."
"Nineteen and five to save me if you don't mind."
"Yes, I know."
"Don't you say yes to me! I'm telling you!"
"This is a private line, you know."
"Private line? I've been on this line for two years."

(R): Well, it's my proud pleasure tonight to introduce one of
The most versatile performers in our career. And he's
Come all the way from Stokely Carmichel's -on-Sea
And I hope you're going to like him. Let's give him a
Big hand ...

(P): (Singing)
Happy New Year, happy Christmas
Happy Easter, happy autumn
Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody
Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you

(J): Once upon a pool table there lived a short-haired
Butcher's boy by the way of Ostergrad. It comes in
Scented cesspool or be careful. Her father was in a
Long story cut short in the middle of his life sentence
We're indebted to the colloquial office for its immediate
Disposal of her honorwitz, including, I might add, half a
Fell of her twotem (*hoc virtallo a totem?). On the other handbag, I mean to say
L'amoure ne soome tu joure realistic, strictly speaking
For this film is about an hourglass houseboat. The full
Meaning of Winchester Cathedral defies description. Their
Loss was our Gainsborough nil

(J (Double Tracked)):
The sound of a manservantile defectively lasting barred
Up in a love-dizzy gar-di-dell time. How close can you
Gettysburg and ever underly council ya originally a
Birdbath feeling?

(G): Cut!
We have a special guest here this evening, Mr
Tiny Tim. I'd like to ask him to say a few words

(T): Oh, hello to you nice Beatles. Ah, it's so wonderful
What a thrill it is talking here. Ah, in Mr. Harrison's
Presence, Mr. Weiss' presence, and all his nice wonderful
Friends. And the thing is, I just wanna say Merry
Christmas to you all. And, ah, a Happy New Year

(G): Thank you, Tiny. Would you like to sing us a little song?

(T): Ah, I'd love to. Here's a song I did in 1966 in front of
Miss Jill for the first time. And I did this in Albert
Hall, and what a thrill it was, ah, to do this then, and
Now ... exactly the way I did it then

(Singing)
He's a, ooh, real nowhere man
Living in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Hasn't got a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man, (yes?) Don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Nowhere man, the world's at your command, ooh

He's a, huh huh, real nowhere man
Living in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody, ooh, ooh

(G): Thank you, Tiny. Thank you and God bless you, Tiny

(T): God bless you all. Oh, God bless you all

 

[Verse 1]
Running to and fro, hard
Working at the mail
Never fail
Get the mail
Yeah, some rotten deal
Ow!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to invite them again

[Verse 2]
Say me
Talking to me
Tryin' to run me up a creek
She used to buy one
Try to pay me again next week
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Long-haired, good-looking
Trying to get me hooked
Or me to marry
Settle down
Get the horn by the bull
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Mediocre money
Being fighting in the hall
Army bunk, army go
Army chow, army cook
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Same thing every day
Getting up, going to school
No need to make complaining
My objection's overruled
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Working in the filling station
Too many tires
Wipe the windows
Check the tire
Check the oil and all the gas
Ow!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Don't want your moderation, get away, leave me

 

Mama!

(J): Now you lads, will you just shout Happy Christmas for us
For this tape, eh?

(?): Happy Christmas?

(J): Yeah. Go on. One, two, three

(All): Happy Christmas!

(J): Thank you. Same to you. Ha, ha. Happy Christmas

(Yoko): ... Christmas, John, and I see you strolling in
Ascot Garden with your wife, Yoko, but well, do you
Have any special thoughts at, for Christmas?

(J): Well, Yoko, it is Christmas and my special thoughts
Of course, turn towards eating

(Y): Ha! Ha! Ha! All right. So, eating. Well, what do you like to eat?

(J): Well, I'd like some cornflakes prepared by Parisian
Hands. And I'd like it blessed by Hari Krishna Mantra

(G): "Yes, have a wonderful Christmas
Have a jolly new year
Make sure that Christmas...

This is George Harrison saying Happy Christmas. Happy

(R): (Singing)
Ooh, good evening to you ladies
Good evening to you gentlemen
Happy to be here
Good evening to you gentlemen
I fear, I fear, I fear
Good evening to you one and all
I hope you will enjoy
The coming sports day of your life
Is mama's little boy

(Y): So, how do you like the garden here?

(J): I think it's simply splendid. I'm overwhelmed by its
Sanctuary

(Y): So, you don't mind these high gates and things and the walls?

(J): Oh, I've always loved the high walls. The Elizabethan high
Wall is something I've always loved. You see

(Y): Yes

(J): Lady

(P): (Singing)
This is to wish you, a merry, merry Christmas
This is to wish you just a merry, merry year
This say to wish you just a happy, happy new year
This is to wish you a merry, merry, merry new year

My hair is a mess

Your mammie will scold
Your pappie will shout
Unless we come in

Kissing you was fun honey
But thanks for the date
But I must come to run honey

We got to go home"

Whoa! Ow!

(All): (Singing) Jingle bells...

(P): Hello, everybody, this is Paul, and I'd just like to thank you all for buying our records during the past year. We know you've been buying 'em because the sales have been very good, you see. Don't know where we'd be without you, really though

(J): In the army, perhaps

(P): Oh, we hope you've enjoyed listening to the records as much as we've enjoyed melting them - No, no, no, that's worng. - making them. We're in No. 2 studio at the moment, at EMI, taping this little message for you

(J): Yes, we are

(P): We are indeed. I just thought I'd make that... This is the same studio we've used all along - since the old days of "Love Me Do" - many years ago it seems, doesn't it?

(J): Ah, those were the days ...

(P): Well, that's about all, I think. Except, to wish you all a Happy Christmas and a very New Year! Now I'll pass you over to John. John!

(J): John. John speakin'. Thanks all of you who bought me book. Thank you folks for buying it. It was very handy. And there's another one out pretty soon, it says here. Hope you buy that, too. It'll be the usual rubbish but it won't cost much. You see, that's the bargain we're going to strike up. I write them in my spare time, it says here. It's been a busy year ....

(P): Did you write this yourself?

(J): No! It's somebody's bad handwriter. It's been a busy year Beatle peadles, one way and another. But it's been a great year, too. You fans have seen to that. Page 2. Thanks a lot folks and a hap-py, ah, Christmas and a merry goo-year. Crimble maybe. And I'll hand you to George who will speak to you - now!

(G): Thank you John. Thank you. Hi there! I'd like to thank all of you for going to see the film. 'spect a lot of you saw it more than once

(R): I did

(G): Did you? So did I. Thanks anyway. 'Cause it makes us very pleased, ya know. We had a quiet time making it. Actually, we didn't. We had a great time making it. And we're glad it turned out okay. The next one should be completely different. We start shooting it in February. This time it's gonna be in color

(J): Green

(G): It'll be a big laugh we hope. (Ha ha ha!) Well, we ... Big laugh, ha ha ha, yeah, it'll be a big laugh

(J): Be a big laugh, you imagine?

(G): And we may see all of you soon. Hope so anyway. All the best. And, happy New Year. And a Happy Christmas. And here's Ringo

(R): Thanks, Geroge. Ringo here. Well, the others have thanked you for all the discs and John's book and for everything - oh, no - for enjoying the film. I'd like to thank you just for being fans. It's been a funny year, you know. One minute we're in England, next, we're away. 'spect you're wondering where we've been. Well, Beatle people, we've been to Australia and America and New (Who's dropping that?) New Zealand. And Australia

(P): And New Zealand

(R): Ha ha! Or is that New Zealand?

(P): So much travelling! But you've stayed loyal, haven't you?

(R): Anyway, those airport receptions knocked us out, man, great!

(J): Dig!

(R): Well, that's about it from me. I'd just like to say, all the best for Christmas and happy new year

Well let me tell you well no chick made could be the same
As Sweet Georgia Brown
Crazy feet that dance so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown
Fella’s sigh, and even cry for Sweet Georgia Brown
I tell you just why you know I don’t lie

It’s been said, she knocks them dead in any old town
Since she came right it’s a shame how she brings them down
In Liverpool she even dare to criticize the Beatles’ hair
With their whole fan club standing there, I mean Sweet Georgia Brown
Alright

I say this group is absolutely marvelous with the piano
Don’t you think so?
Not too commercial boys, not too commercial!

When it comes to music Sweet Georgia known to mind
Don’t buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist
I never would try to tell you just why use your imagination

There's a DJ crazy for her living in out home town
Since she came like it’s a shame, she turns him down
Records that she can get are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina, but that don’t have Georgia Brown

Oh such Sweet Georgia
Yeah yeah yeah I mean brown, oh oh oh
Sweet Georgia Brown

[Intro: John Lennon]
It doesn't matter much to me

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

 

Each time I look into your eyes
I see that there, there heaven lies
And as I look
I see the love of the loved

Someday they'll see that from the start
My place has been deep in your heart
And in your heart
I see the love of the loved

Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure
You love me

And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me
And say ah you love me

So let it rain, I'll never care
Deep in your heart, I'll still be there
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved

Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure
You love me

And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me
And say ah you love me

So let it rain, I'll never I care
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there
And when I'm there

I see the love of the loved
I see the love of the loved
I see the love of the loved

 

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!

[Chorus]

 

[Intro]
Da da da da da dum dum dum
Da da da da da dum dum dum
Da da da da da dum dum dum

[Verse]
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything we can do
Just call on us and we'll send it along
With love from us to you
To you
To you
To you

 

[Chorus 1]
Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow
And I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine
Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow
And I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine

[Chorus 2]
I can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
How must I forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes?

[Chorus 3]
You've broken my heart
Gonna do it again
And I can't forget
The spell that I'm in
Can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
I'm a-trying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse]
She wrote me only one sad night
Told me she's no longer mine
Sue sue mailman, that will do for sometime

[Chorus] [x2]
Mailman, bring me no more blues
Mailman, bring me no more blues
One more heartache is all I can use

 

You can knock me down
Slap my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do
But oh oh honey
Lay of them blue suede shoes
Now don't you step
On my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay of them blue suede shoes
Ah go!
You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From a old fruit jar
Do anything
That you want to do
But ah ah honey
Lay of them blue suede shoes
And don't you step
On my blue suede shoes, please
Well you can do anything
But lay of them blue suede shoes
Ah go, hit it, Carl (Perkins)!

One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot dang gilly

Yeah the goose pimples baby
Because I feel so good
When you call me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Ooh mercy, I'm rock gone puppy

Your touch sewed me
Like an electric wire
Never thought of make love
It don't take much looking
To see what I've got
But it shows, yes it shows
Come on honey Bonnie

Crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
I just can't seem to get you off my mind
Crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
You're the one I love, I think about you all the time

[Chorus] [x2]
Crying, do do do do, tear keep a falling all night long
Waiting, do do do do, it seems so useless I know it's wrong
Keep a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
Maybe someday soon it'll change and you'll be mine

 

Way down upon the Swanee River
Far, far away
That's where my heart is yearning ever
Home where the old folks stay
Way down upon the Swanee River
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever
Home where the old folks stay
All up and down the whole creation
Sadly I roam
I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation
Oh, for the old folks at home
Ah-oh-oh!
Oh, my my!
Well, way down upon the Swanee River
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever
Home where the old folks stay
All up and down the whole creation
Sadly I roam
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation
And for the old folks at home
All the world is sad and dreary
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home

 

[Speech]

[Rodney Burke] Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it. What is it?
[John] It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead
[Rodney] Oh!
[John] It says, "Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all
A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at school"
Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling "Clarabella"

 

I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need you
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tied up
Tied up

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me

 

[Intro]
They say that everyone wants someone
So how come no one wants me
And they say that eveyone needs someone
So how come no one needs me

[Chorus] [x2]
Well if you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
Well they're the ugly duckling, the little black sheep, and me
Uh huh
They say that everyone loves someone
So how come no one loves me

To sing 'You Really Got a Hold on Me' for Di, Gus, Wizz, and me, also for the
Beatles, themselves, especially Paul," ha, "and everybody that was in the Roy
Orbison Tour. I'm a regular listener of 'Pop Go the Beatles,'" good lad, "and
Please, tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show

My tears are falling
'cos you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There something that I got to say:

Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do

Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint rainbows all around her
Don't let her see the cloudy sky

Once upon a time
That little girl was mine

If I had been true
I know she'd never been with you

So take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby

 

Day after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Is talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And he never listen to them
He knows that they're the fools
But they don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
Oh

 

[Verse 1]
[Brian Matthew] The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--

[John] Hey! Listen!
[Paul] It's all changed, now, Brian They're not doing that, no actors
[John] It's all changed, now
[Brian] But this is what I wonder In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor Did you find that?
[John] No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film You should have seen the rest


[Verse 2]
[Brian] Yes?
[John] Rubbish!

And in the end the love you take
Is equal to the love you make

 

Step inside love and stay

Come in out of the cold

Rest your head on my shoulder
And kiss me tonight

Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques'fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
And lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world

The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feats on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late
Messers K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

 

Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Always know sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean, ah yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever

 

One, two, one, two, three, four

[Instrumental]

 

Good morning
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say, but it's OK

[Bridge: John Lennon]
People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's OK

 

[Intro]
Ooh! My soul

[Chorus]
Well baby baby baby baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey honey honey honey
Said get off of that money
Love love love love
Ooh! My soul

[Verse]
Well give me give me give me give me give me
Give me all the love you got
Baby baby baby baby
Don't you know I want a lot
Love love love love
Ooh! My soul

[Chorus] [x2]

 

[Instrumental]

 

I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well here's a place you know just as real
It's just another place you can go
Where everything flows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well here's a place you know just as real
It's just another place you can go
Where everything flows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half lives (gibberish)
Looking through a glass onion (gibberish)

I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well here's a place you know just as real (ooh)
It's just another place you can go
Where everything flows (help!)
Looking through the bent backed tulips (gibberish)
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion (gibberish... ahh...)

 

I'm pedro the fisherman
I fish by night and day
Unfortunately i live in bristol
Far far away
And there ain't no fish to be caught
No fish to be caught
There ain't no sea
The counseller came
Away from me
I'm pedro the fisherman
With not a fish to fash
Ive got a hook on the line
Big mac
A top
Some red socks
A pair of wellies
And a bit of wine
So im goin to go

 

[Verse 1]
I found it out
What love is all about
And every day
It sure lets out
I see my baby
I get weak in my knees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
My pappie told me
There'd be times like these
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

[Verse 2]
We meet the gang
And go to rocking Joes
The cats are something
On the heels and toes
I grab my baby
Tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be
Such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I begged her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some loving, baby
Please please please

[Chorus]
Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

 

[Verse 1]
Well shake it up baby now (shake it up baby)
Twist and shout (twist and shout)
C’mon c’mon c’mon c’mon baby now (c’mon baby)
C’mon and work it on out (work it on out)

Well Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby now (shake it up baby)
Well Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby now (shake it up baby)
Ah... ah.. ah.. ah..

 

[Spoken Intro - George Harrison]
You all will have read that Dave Dee is no longer with us. But Mickey and Tich and I would just like to carry on the good work that's always gone down in number two

All through the day, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
All through the night, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day I me mine

I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine

All I can hear, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life, I me mine

 

[Speech]

[Lee Peters] But now, John has his work cut out on the next one
As he takes his guitar on and off his neck and pulls the harmonica in and out of his face
[John] Harp. It's a harp
[Lee] What? Harp?
[John] The harp. Because I'm playing the harp on this one
[Lee] Playing the harp?
[John] Harmonica I play on "Love Me Do," harp, on this one, little goes in the orange
[Lee] But it goes in and out? Do you want to do this announcement?
Well, go on, you go ahead, no, it's all right. Tell them. Tell them about the next song
[John] Oh, er, we'd like to carry on with Chuck Berry's "I Got to Find My Baby"
Don't know where she's been, pardon, hello? Love these goon shows

 

I've got something to tell you, I'm in love
I've been longing to tell you, I'm in love
You'll believe me, when I tell you, I'm in love with you
You're my kind of girl
You make me feel proud
You make me want to shout aloud
Yes, I, m telling all my friends, I'm in love
Every night I can't sleep, thinking of you
And ev'ry little thing that you do
Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I, m in love
Oh yeh, I'm sittin' on the top of the world
I'm in love with a wonderful girl
And I never felt so good before
If this is love, give me more, more, more
Every night I can't sleep, thinking of you
And ev'ry little thing that you do
Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love
Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love, in love
Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love

 

[Speech]

[Rodney Burke] I've got one card here and it's on the same subject, eh, but this one says
"We think the show is great and we dig the Beatles the most, but we still haven't heard a word from Ringo yet"
[Ringo] Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!
[Rodney] "And how about him singing?" Well, what will you sing for us, Ringo? Will you say a few words?
[Ringo] Hello, there, kiddies. I'd like to sing a song for you today called "Matchbox." There you go
[Rodney] Set fire to that lot. Okay, Ringo, thanks very much
[Ringo] Don't you bet smart with me, you know
[Rodney] Do you mind? Get over to your microphone, "Matchbox"

 

[Verse 1]
I'm going to search this town
From door to door
The love I crave
I can't find no more

[Chorus]
I got to find my baby
I declare there is no lie
I never had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 2]
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
Because I know my whole life's
Going to be one solid mess

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever done in my life
Is to find that little woman
Make her my wife

[Chorus]

 

(Take 7)
(OK man, let's go, the light's on

1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline

The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair, what a scene!

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. Kite will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. Kite

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

 

Here I stand, head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and everyday
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you got to hide your love away
Hey, you got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find away?
Gather round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you got to hide your love away
Hey, you got to hide your love away

 

I'm just sitting here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissing, baby, oh oh baby
I've been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town

You don't love me anymore
I'll get over you baby
Although my heart's still sore
You know my heart's still sore

Well, I think of all the lies you told
You're a junk man, my heart you sold
You're a cheater and a mean mis treater
When I think of all the fun we had

Kind of makes me feel so sad
And I'm lonely for your love and as long as I live
It's only you I'll be thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of

 

You're a stranger in my arms
When i saw you standing there
Without a wooly ho i hair
You're a stranger in my arms
You're a stranger in my arms
I want it so much
And me on a road somewhere
You're a stranger in my arms
When the lights are very low
And the sky is on the celing
And there's no one there to know
Oh its gone off

 

[Speech]

[Paul] Yes?
[Alan] Now, listen
[Paul] Yes?
[Alan] Are you singing?
[Paul] Mmm
[Alan] Do you have any particular idol that you've ever copied your singing style from?
[John] What about my book?
[Alan] John, go away
[John] What about my
[Paul] Used to be sort of influenced by Elvis in the old days, I think
[Alan] Really?
[Paul] Yeah, used to love him
[John] What about my book, then?
[Paul] Chuck Berry, Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, and, eh, Marvin Gaye and things
Can't really sing like them, you know. I like them, though love them
[John] What about it?
[Alan] Paul, what about singing "Till There Was You"?

 

When I was sitting on my piano one day
A magical thought came my way
To write a number for the BBC
Kenny Everett McCartney
All together on the wireless machine
Kenny Everett McCartney
All together on the wireless machine
Kenny Everett McCartney
All together on the wireless machine

 

I'm sure to fall
Fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet
And so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

 

It was twenty years ago today

But they're guaranteed to raise a smile

Grab my rock 'n' roll baby, pour on the steam

Gonna rock 'n' roll 'til the early early night

[John] Yeah
[Brian] To prove we weren't playing the record, then, you see 'Cause, otherwise, there's no point in you being here, is there? Ha, ha, ha!
[John] Yeah, we did that, 'cause it sounds just like it, don't it?
[Brian] Pretty cool lot of fellows, aren't you? Here, Ringo, have a banana, catch!

 

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

 

Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

[Chorus:]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot

[Chorus:]
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away

[Chorus:]
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead

[Chorus:]

 

Mein Herz ist bei dir nur, my darling
Mein Herz fand bei dir nur das Glück
Noch trennen uns Länder und Meere
Doch bald kehre ich wieder zurück

My Bonnie lies over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea
Well, my Bonnie lies over the ocean
Yeah, bring back my Bonnie to me

Yeah, bring back, ah, bring back, (now)
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Oh, bring, oh bring back (now), ah, bring back
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me

Whoa!
Ah! ho! ho! ho!
Ah! go! go! go! go!
Ho! ho! ho!
Go! go! go!
Oh ho! oh ho!
(I know) Well, my Bonnie lies over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea
Well, my Bonnie lies over the ocean
Yeah, bring back my Bonnie to me

(I know) Yeah, bring back, (now) ah, bring back
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me. (now)
Oh, bring back, (now) ah, bring back
Ho! Bring back my Bonnie to me

Control room: No reply, take one!
One two three four, one

This happened once before
When I came to your door no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light
I know that you saw me
Cause I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home that's a lie
Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door (your face)
I nearly died
Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
Your face

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

This happened once before (oh yeah)
When I came to your door no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through-- your face

 

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

 

Day after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Is talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And he never listen to them
He knows that they're the fools
But they don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
Oh

Mr. Moonlight
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine
I think you're fine
Cos we love you, Mr. Moonlight

Begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I'll pray and pray more each day
Cos we love you, Mr. Moonlight

Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
'cause my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge

Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry homedrops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

 

Rodney Burke: I've got one card here and it's on the same subject, eh, but this one says, "We think the show is great and we dig the Beatles the most, but we still haven't heard a word from Ringo yet."
Ringo: Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!
Rodney: "And how about him singing?" Well, what will you sing for us, Ringo? Will you say a few words?
Ringo: Hello, there, kiddies. I'd like to sing a song for you today called "Matchbox." There you go
Rodney: Set fire to that lot. Okay, Ringo, thanks very much
Ringo: Don't you et smart with me, you know
Rodney: Do you mind? Get over to your microphone, "Matchbox."

Down in Eastern Australia
I met her
She was wearing a red blue sweater
I asked her who knitted the sweater
She said never mind

 

Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you

 

Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour
Step right this way

Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away, take you today

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

Wo, wo, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Whoa

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride
And she don't care

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Alan Freeman: George, is it true that you're a connoisseur of the classics?
George: No, it's just a rumour, a rumour
Alan: Just a rumour?
George: Hmm
Alan: Did you enjoy singing "Beethoven"?
George No. Been singing it for 28 years, now, you know
Alan: For how long?
George: Twenty-eight years
Alan: That's incredible. Could you manage one more performance?
George: Um, possibly
Alan: Oh, go on, say, "yes."
George: Yes, thank you

 

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologise
If you don't really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Well I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
Cos I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

We are traveling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)

Oh when the saints go marching in

Oh lord I want to be in that number

We've, we've just flown in to Manchester here from London to record this show. Ha, ha. Well, it's, ha, ha, it's good to see you again, fellers, in these, er, foreign parts. How are you?

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper

Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

He's such a mean old man
He's such a mean old man

His sister Shelly works in a shop
She never stops
She's a go-getter

Takes him out to look to look at the Queen
The only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

He's such a dirty old man
He's such a dirty old man

Hey Mean Mr. Mustard
Such a dirty, dirty Mean Mr. Mustard
Such a dirty, dirty Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper

Sleeps in a hole in the road
Save enough to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

[Outro]

Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man...
