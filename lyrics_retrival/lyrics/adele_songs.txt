[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

 

[Verse 1]
I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

[Verse 2]
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

[Bridge]
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't want to be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

 

[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Bridge]
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
Cause I still care, do you still care?

[Breakdown]
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young

 

[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship [shit] bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus 1]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

[Chorus 2]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

[Bridge]
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[Breakdown]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Chorus 1]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Chorus 1]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat

 

[Intro]
Just the guitar?
Okay, cool

[Verse 1]
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me
Mmm, told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me
Mmm, that was what you told me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Verse 2]
I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)
Mmm, baby, I'm still rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)
Mmm, there's only one way down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Bridge]
If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Outro]
If you're ready, if you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready?
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready?
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

 

[Verse 1]
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if I’m not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

[Outro]
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Hook 1]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Hook 1]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Hook 2]
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

[Hook 1]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Hook 2]
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Outro]
Oh, oh, no
Let it burn
Oh, oh, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn

 

[Verse 1]
I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I'd end up with you

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

[Verse 2]
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

[Breakdown]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

[Verse 1]
I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

[Chorus 1]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

[Verse 2]
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

[Chorus 2]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

[Outro]
A million years ago

 

[Verse 1]
This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall

[Verse 2]
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

[Bridge]
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall

 

[Verse 1]
I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
Then kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

[Verse 2]
I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do, baby
Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

[Bridge]
We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder, baby
It only makes it harder, baby
Harder baby, harder baby

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

[Outro]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

 

[Verse 1]
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

[Chorus 1]
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

[Verse 2]
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

[Instrumental Breakdown]

[Chorus 2]
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

[Outro]
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

 

[Verse 1]
Take your eyes off me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time cause I don't love you anymore

Please stay where you are, don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind

[Chorus]
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

[Verse 2]
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight

Please don't fall apart, I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay

[Chorus]
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

[Bridge]
We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live and not just survive

[Chorus]
That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me

 

[Verse 1]
I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw my heart, it came to life
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be, every story has its scars

[Chorus]
But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be
I will be your remedy

[Verse 2]
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whatever, I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth and I will always love you
Love you, oh

[Chorus]
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be
I will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhh
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be, I will be
I will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhh

 

[Verse 1]
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

[Chorus]
So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

[Verse 2]
Under haunted skies, I see you
Ooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

[Chorus]
So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turning tables

[Bridge]
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior when the thunder calls for me
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior, standing on my own two feet

[Chorus]
I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

[Outro]
Turning tables, yeah
Turn, no, no, no-oh

 

[Verse 1]
You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Verse 2]
Have I been on your mind?
You hang on every word I say and lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me whichever road I choose, you'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mmm, to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Bridge]
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

[Chorus]
So, I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Outro]
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

 

[Verse 1]
When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the state we were in

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Verse 2]
When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Bridge]
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

[Chorus]
Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Outro]
When will I see you again?

 

[Verse 1]
Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
That I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and manmade
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

[Chorus]
But it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

[Verse 2]
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I would rather say it now in case I never get the chance

[Pre-Chorus]
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

[Chorus]
But it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

[Outro]
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea
The River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea-ea-ea

 

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
With your loving, there ain't nothing that I can't adore
The way I'm running with you, honey
Means we can break every law
I find it funny that you're the only one I never looked for
There is something in your loving that tears down my walls

[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

[Chorus]
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

[Verse 2]
I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all along

[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

[Chorus]
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

[Bridge]
I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
You're my light, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
You're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope of everything, everywhere

[Chorus]
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

[Outro]
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest devotion

 

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
She, she ain't real
She ain't gon be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you
And boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore

[Chorus]
Rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)

[Verse 2]
She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Bless your soul)
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it, I'm the one you're leaving her for

[Chorus]
Rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)

[Bridge]
All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bare to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

[Chorus]
Rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)

[Breakdown]
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)

[Outro]
But rumour has it, he's the one I'm leaving you for

 

[Verse 1]
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering"

[Chorus]
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

[Verse 2]
I like it in the city
When the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

[Refrain]
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

[Chorus]
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met, yeah

[Outro]
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world
Yeah, of my world
Of my world, yeah

 

[Verse 1]
When did it go wrong? I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down? I go round and around
Thinking about it all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

[Verse 2]
Why were you so cold? Let the truth be told
Tell me, was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking? I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

[Bridge]
Oooh, sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh, I thought I'd die in your arms

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

[Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go

 

[Verse 1]
Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

[Chorus 1]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

[Verse 2]
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

[Chorus 1]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

[Bridge]
There will be times we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us

[Chorus 1]
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk

[Verse 3]
Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
"I'll be home so soon, I won't be late"

[Chorus 2]
He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

[Chorus 3]
'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

 

[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

[Chorus]
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

[Verse 2]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

[Chorus]
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I'll always love you

[Outro]
I'll always love you
'Cause I love you
Love, love

 

[Intro]
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?

[Verse 1]
Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
'Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide

[Chorus]
It’s above and beyond me, it’s out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

[Verse 2]
Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, inside of my head
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

[Bridge]
You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, inside of my head
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

[Outro]
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?

 

[Verse 1]
Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

[Verse 2]
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

[Chorus]
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

[Verse 3]
Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

[Bridge]
There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for

[Chorus]
But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life

 

[Verse 1]
Right under my feet is air made of bricks
That pulls me down and turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Then, I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

[Chorus 1]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

[Verse 2]
Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So, desperately, I try to link it with my head
But instead, I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

[Chorus 1]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

[Bridge]
Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up and leave me there

[Chorus 2]
Well, I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one
In love, I'm the only one in love

 

[Verse 1]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to
Every part of me, all my words to hold
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say my love, "open up your heart"
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

[Chorus]
Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won’t you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)

[Verse 2]
I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

[Chorus]
Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)

[Bridge]
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

[Chorus]
Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)

 

[Verse 1]
Didn't I give it all? Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to, well having me around
Still how can you walk away from all my tears?
Its gonna be an empty road without me right here

[Chorus]
But go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

[Verse 2]
Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing gets better than this
And this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this

[Chorus]
But go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

[Bridge]
I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do is all for you

[Chorus]
But go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

 

[Verse 1]
So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

[Chorus]
Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind

[Post-Chorus]
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

[Verse 2]
This love has dried up, and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me, first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new

[Chorus]
Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgive me
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love

 

[Verse 1]
Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

[Chorus]
Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 2]
Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

[Chorus]
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you

 

[Verse 1]
Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters but you pushed me in
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

[Verse 2]
Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your walls around me pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then but now I'm willing to learn

[Pre-Chorus]
But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

[Bridge]
Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless
I'll be waiting

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

 

[Verse 1]
I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees

[Hook]
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

[Verse 2]
So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, "Will you leave your man?"
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you

[Hook]
'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

[Bridge]
I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes
And settle for wrong and ignore the right

[Hook]
When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now, but I don't need you

 

[Verse 1: Adele]
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

[Chorus: Both]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

[Verse 2: Darius Rucker]
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door, yeah
Wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

[Chorus: Both]
It's a quarter after one, I'm little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

[Bridge: Both]
Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

[Chorus: Both]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

[Outro: Both]
I just need you now
Oh, I need you now
Oh baby, I need you now
I just need you now

 

[Verse 1]
Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end
And it's been waitin' for you to open up yours too
Baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

[Pre-Chorus]
That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

[Chorus]
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me

[Verse 2]
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say

[Pre-Chorus]
I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

[Chorus]
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me

[Bridge]
But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me, more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around
And I will do until I find myself with you

[Outro]
And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

[Verse 1]
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes, and you're on your own
You can say, "I chose to be alone"
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

[Chorus]
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

[Verse 2]
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
And even then, you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

[Chorus]
See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of (love)

[Bridge]
Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then
When we were both right, and no one had blame
But now, I give up on this endless game

[Verse 3]
'Cause who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes, and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

[Chorus]
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of—

[Outro]
No room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of love

 

[Verse 1]
This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
And It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Verse 2]
Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home, I call that home

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Verse 3]
Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away

 

Thank you for the time I've been given
Thank you to everybody for your love and kindness, for your honesty and persuasion
Thank you for telling me how it is but entertaining what I wanted it to be
Thank you for listening and for letting me into your lives again

Love Adele x

[Verse 1]
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

[Verse 2]
These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

[Bridge]
Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
And even in the daylight when your gaming
(I don't see through)
I try to look for thing I hear but my eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

 

[Verse 1]
Hold my hand
While you cut me down
It'd only just begun
But now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments
With your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes
You were smiling in the spotlight
Dancing with the night
The night fell off your mind

[Chorus]
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

[Verse 2]
Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking, punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer
You obviously prefer her

[Chorus]
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

[Bridge]
I should have known

[Verse 3]
Never mind
Said your open arms
I couldn't help believe
The trick me back into them

[Chorus]
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

 

[Intro]
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye

[Chorus]
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say, "*Pfft*, I've known you longer, my dear"
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all
But we do, but we do, do-do-do
But we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do

[Verse]
I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You'd think we wouldn't, we do, but we do, do-do-do
But we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do

[Bridge]
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Your, your-your, your
Your, your-your, your...
Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation, I'll be glad
Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation, I'll be glad to make an exception (Woah, oh)

[Chorus]
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say, "*Pfft*, I've known you longer, my dear"
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all
But we do

 

[Verse 1]
Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Never would've seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Would've been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

[Hook]
Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

[Verse 2]
Never would've gone to that side of town
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've took a mind to track him down
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
And put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

 

[Verse 1]
In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can barely see the light
I make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own

[Chorus]
You'll never see me again,  I’ll be better in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again

[Verse 2]
At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stength00
But I'm stronger now

[Chorus]
You'll never see me again  I’ll be better in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again

 

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
To tell you

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
To tell you

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Ending]
Hello?

 

Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh

In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I, I miss my baby

 

Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Ooh

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me
I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel
Leave

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
So scratch my itch and beat my drum
So i can start to begin what's begun

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
Ooh
Scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

 

[Verse 1]
Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with the words that cry
How I still try to stay inside

[Chorus]
Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts

[Verse 2]
Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd have made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here

 

[Verse 1]

چشمهاتو ازم بردار تا بتونم ترکت کنم
انقدر شرمنده‌ام که نمیتونم وقتی نگاهم میکنی از پیشت برم
این جریان هیچوقت تموم نمیشه، قبلا هم توی این وضعیت بودیم
ولی دیگه این دفعه نمیتونم بمونم، چون دیگه دوستت ندارم
خواهش میکنم همونجایی که هستی بمون
نزدیک‌تر نیا
سعی نکن نظر منو عوض کنی
اگه نامهربونی میکنم، به خاطر اینه که میخوام مهربون باشم [بهترین راه واسه تموم کردن این رابطه همین بی‌رحمی و نامهربونیه]

[Chorus]

نمیتونم توی این تاریکی دوستت داشته باشم
حس میکنم که بینمون اقیانوس‌ها فاصله‌ست
بینمون خیلی فاصله افتاده
شاید همین الان هم رابطه‌مون شکست خورده
....همه چیز منو تغییر داد

[Verse 2]

تو یه چیزی بهم دادی که بدون اون نمیتونم زندگی کنم
نباید شک و تردید [توی رابطه] رو دست کم بگیری
ولی من نمیخوام ادامه بدم و تظاهر کنم که همه چی مرتبه
هر چی بیشتر این قضیه رو نادیده بگیریم، بیشتر درگیری ایجاد میشه
خواهش میکنم دل‌شکسته نشو
من طاقت روبرو شدن با قلبِ شکستۀ تو رو ندارم
من دارم سعی میکنم که شجاع باشم
هی ازم نخواه که بمونم

[Chorus]

نمیتونم توی این تاریکی دوستت داشته باشم
حس میکنم که بینمون اقیانوس‌ها فاصله‌ست
بینمون خیلی فاصله افتاده
شاید همین الان هم رابطه‌مون شکست خورده
....همه چیز منو تغییر داد

[Bridge]

فقط ما نیستیم که این مشکل رو داریم
من از هیچی پشیمون نیستم
هیچکدوم از حرفایی که زدم
میدونی که هیچوقت نظرم درموردت عوض نمیشه [همیشه دوستت خواهم داشت ولی دیگه نه اونجوری...]
اینکه تو توی زندگیم هستی
یک دنیا برام ارزش داره
ولی من میخوام زندگی کنم
نه اینکه فقط زنده بمونم

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]

به خاطر همین نمیتونم توی این تاریکی دوستت داشته باشم
حس میکنم که بینمون اقیانوس‌ها فاصله‌ست
بینمون خیلی فاصله افتاده
شاید همین الان هم رابطه‌مون شکست خورده
....همه چیز منو تغییر داد

فکر نمیکنم بتونی نجاتم بدی

 

[Verse 1]
I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But, how will you ever know if you never try?
There's something new inside my heart
And it cries like a child whenever we're apart
I've seen your face under every sky
I find the less I look, the more I find

[Chorus]
So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
You know I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But, I'm fearless and brave when I'm in the arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me upright
When I'm short of falling

[Chorus]
So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

[Bridge]
There will be times
When we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams
No doubt that we'll almost fall apart
Then burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But, without each other, nothing else is enough

[Chorus]
So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

[Outro]
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no

 

Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronise
Don't patronise me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel somethin' that it won't
And here in the dark, these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I will feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me when you don't
When you don't, yeah

I close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel when you're home with me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel somethin' that it won't
And here in the dark, these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I will feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me when you don't
When you don't, you
When you don't, yeah

 

[Adele]
Thank you very much. Thank you. First of all, I really do apologize for swearing. I just... this means... George Michael, I love him, it means a lot to me, so I'm really sorry if I offended anyone anywhere

Everyone, this is Greg Kurstin. Give it up for Greg Kurstin. Thank you very much for this award. Thank you to the Academy, thank you to my record labels XL and Sony, thank you to my manager, Jonathan. I always get so nervous... And I'd like to thank Greg, because Greg kept coming to England for me, to work with me. And I was really hard work this record, had a very short attention span, and he would come to me in England so that I didn't have to leave my son, and yet you would leave your son and daughter. So thank you for your patience with me and for helping to create my favorite song I've ever done. So thank you, Greg

...Thank you to my mom and dad...

 

If fish swam out of the ocean and grew legs and they started
Walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking

And the stars fell out of the sky and my tears rolled into
The ocean
Now I'm looking for a reason why you even set my world into
Motion

'Cause if you're not really here then the stars don't even
Matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear but it's all just a
Bunch of matter

'Cause if you're not really here then I don't wanna be
Either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Yeah

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I looked up into the grey sky and see a thousand eyes
Staring back
And all around these golden beacons I see nothing but black

I feel a way of something beyond them
Don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation then most of my life isn't
Real

'Cause if you're not really here then the stars don't even
Matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear but it's all just a
Bunch of matter

'Cause if you're not really here then I don't want to be
Either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold

Black and gold
Black and gold
Oh

'Cause if you're not really here then the stars don't even
Matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear but it's all just a
Bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here then I don't wanna be
Either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
If you're not really here then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold

 

[Intro: Adele]
All the things you'd say
All the things you'd say

[Instrumental: Adele & Thomas Gold]
All the things you'd say

[Verse 1: Adele]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus: Adele]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

[Hook 1: Adele]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

[Instrumental: Adele & Thomas Gold]
All the things you'd say, they
But I set fire

[Outro: Adele & Thomas Gold]
All the things you'd say
All the things you'd say

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home anymore
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home anymore
