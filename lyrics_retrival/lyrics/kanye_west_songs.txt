Yuugh! It's prime time, my top back, this pimp game, ho
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho
I'm bill-droppin', Ms. Pac-Man, this pill-poppin' ass ho
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin': that's exorcist
My Audemars like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time, and that's excellence
Two-door preference
Roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Hines is irrelevant, woo

Wherever we go, we do it pronto, it's like—

[Verse 3: Kanye West & 2 Chainz]
Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus

You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melting like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby (yah)
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans (2 Chainz)

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz & Big Sean]
Okay, now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane (tell 'em)
Spit rounds like a gun range (baow)
Beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl
Now your girl need a Band-Aid (damn)
Grade A, A1
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin'
Co-signed by Louis Vuitton (yep)
Horsepower, horsepower
All this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand
Now I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain (rain) pourin' (pourin')
All my cars is foreign (foreign)
All my broads is foreign (foreign)
Money tall like Jordan

[Verse: Kanye West & Kelly Price]
Now, if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'ma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'

Remind me where I know you from
She lookin' like she owe you some'n
You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my...
I wanna wake up with you in my...

[Chorus: Kanye West & The-Dream]
I'm tryna keep my faith
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
This is everything

[Verse 1: Kanye West & The-Dream]
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us loving
We know we need it
You know we need it

That's why we need you now, oh
Pray for Paris
Pray for the parents
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is a God dream

[Refrain: The-Dream & Choir]
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith

[Verse 2: Kelly Price & Choir]
So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(War) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family  from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap  photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

[Refrain: The-Dream, Natalie Is Great & Choir]
(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war

[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war

What of the dollar you murdered for?
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
Or your brother's the one that you're running from?
But if you got money, fuck it, ‘cause I want some

[Big Sean]
B-I-G, who fuckin' with me?
Oh, God! Okay

[Hook: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique

Clique, clique, clique, clique

Clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man
They want the, they want the, they want the

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
(B-I-G, oh God! Go)
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me, like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day (spa day)
Yup, she tryin' to get me that poon-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu-Tang
I'm rollin' with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!
I'm pullin' up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fuckin' villain
Man, they kneelin' when I'm walking in the buildin'
Freaky women I be feelin' from the bank accounts I'm fillin'
What a feelin'! Ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D
That's killing everything that he see for the dough

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique

(Click clack, stick 'em up!)
Yeah, I'm talkin' Ye, yeah, I'm talkin' Rih
Yeah, I'm talkin' B, nigga, I'm talkin' me
Yeah, I'm talkin' bossy, I ain't talkin' Kelis
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
Yeah, I'm talkin' LeBron, we ball in our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin
Ain't nothin' fuckin' with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me
Now, who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation: I'm the shit, least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years
Ain't hug his son since the second grade
Uh, he never told—who he gonna tell?
We top of the totem pole
It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green, it only means one thing
You ain't fuckin' with the clique

[Hook: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival, the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hangin' off the Eiffel
Yeah, I'm talkin' business, we talkin' CIA
I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know, white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me, but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk, he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talkin' to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess he's talkin' back
Fuckin' with my clique

[Outro: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
And all these bad bitches, man
They want the, they want the, they want the
Go!

 

[Intro: Bon Iver]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gonna do now?"
Whatever I want to do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, "Dutty Wine" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit

I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Bridge: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro: Kanye West, Frank Ocean & Kóbor János]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt (mhm-igh)
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

[Intro: Nina Simone]
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah, I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

[Verse 2]
We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

[Verse 3]
You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

[Bridge]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'd die for my...

[Verse 4]
To all my second string bitches, try and get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to JAY-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That goin' to that owin' money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie, yeah
'til death but do your part, unholy matrimony

[Outro]
That summer night holdin' long and long, 'din long
Now waiting for the summer rose and (breathe)
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And live and learn
And live and learn
And livin' and livin' like I’m lonely
Lonely, lonely
And livin' all I have
And livin' all
And live
And live

[Verse 1]
For my theme song (black)
My leather black jeans on (black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (black)
Enter the kingdom (black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (black)
Came to see me in my black skin (black)
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (black)
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit (black)
Early morning cartoon shit (black)
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch (black)
Black out the room, bitch (black)
Stop all that coon shit (black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (black)
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened?
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready—ready for action—action

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Outro]
God! God! God! God!

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make-believe, rappin' about my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
'Cause my niggas still sellin' dope
Like they ain't on their third strikes
Campin' out in that corridor, fuck you waitin' on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for twenty-three
Just meet me somewhere 'round Baltimore
(Woo!) That's rare, nigga (Woo!) Ric Flair, nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair, nigga
(Woo!) I give this beat the chair, nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit, ungrateful niggas I don't like—rrrah!

(This Chicago, nigga!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
A smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound: that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike
(Whoa-oh-oh) A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
(Whoa-oh-oh) But I'd never hit a woman, never in my life
(Ayy!) I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
(Ayy!) In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
(Whoa-oh-oh) Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
(Whoa-oh-oh) Eatin' good: vegetarian with the brown rice
(Ayy!) Girls kissin' girls, ‘cause it's hot, right?
(Ayy!) But unless they use a strap-on, then they not dykes
(Whoa-oh-oh) They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
(Whoa-oh-oh) We hangin' out the window: it's about to be a Suge night
(Ayy!) Free Bump J, real nigga for life
(Ayy!) Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man, that nigga nice
(Whoa-oh-oh) Shoutout to L.E.P., Jay Boogie, right?
(Whoa-oh-oh) Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?!

A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
(Young Chop on the beat)

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like (nah, nah)
Smokin' on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe (nah)
Screamin', "Sosa, that's that nigga that I like!" (Sosa)
I don't want relations, I just want one night (one night)
‘Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like (nah)
I got tats up on my arm ‘cause this shit is life (that's life, tatted)
And I stunt so much in clothes ‘cause I'm livin' life (life)
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealin' light
Bitch, I'm high off life, got me feelin' right (300)
Bitch, I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like!
An-an-and bitch, we GBE, we just go on sight

[Hook: Chief Keef & Big Sean]

A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (right now)
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
Chief Keef, Chi-Town, D-Town, you know?

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Whoa, we are not one and the same
Nigga, I'm fuckin' insane, fuck is you sayin'?
Yo' ass been doin' the same
Shit, not doin' what you sayin', dang
I told yo' old bitch she was fuckin' a lame
Turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holdin' that pain
I just hope you been prayin'—bang bang!
Ridin' for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlives
And I run this bitch like it's no lights
Goin' hard the whole night 'cause I ain't goin' back to my old life
I promise

[Hook: Chief Keef & Jadakiss]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like (right now!)
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (nah!)
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (right now!)
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
HEEEEH!

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I done sold purp (purple), I done sold white (white)
Runnin' outta work, that's that shit I don't like (nah)
She never let me hit it (nah), she gave me dome twice (haha)
She blowin' up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em, just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother thirty for the Jesus (uh-huh)
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas!

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & Ant Clemons]
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Pussy good, go 'n back it up
Pipe her up, I'ma pipe her up
Make her mine, I done fell in love
Juicy thing, make that pussy sing
One more time, baby, do it big
Make it cry, come boohoo this shit

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy a sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it on girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now, let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome: me, you, and a blunt
I love your titties 'cause they prove
I can focus on two things at once

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ayy, none of us'd be here without cum
Ayy, if it ain't all about the income
Ayy, ayy, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ayy, if you drivin' 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ayy, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

 

[Verse]
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

 

[Intro: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah, we still hood famous

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
Get 'em!

[Bridge: Sister Nancy & Swizz Beatz]
Bam, 'ey 'ey 'ey

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing, too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

[Chorus: Kanye West, Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "What's up, fam? Hope you good"
You say, "I'm good, I'm great," the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus: Kanye West,  Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

 

[Intro: Johnny "Guitar" Watson + Junie Morrison]
La-di-da-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (la-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & (Ghostface Killah)]
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more
Los Angeles
Please (shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Please (shake that body, party that body)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm—well, cutie—I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah-Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said, "K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet"
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, LA, it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker

[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know who can take your place

[Chorus: Kanye West & Junie Morrison]
Please, no more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more
Los Angeles

[Outro: Junie Morrison]
Let me tell you, I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Intro]
I’m living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 1]
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain’t got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I’ll see you in the morning
Huh? I’ll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Chorus]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 2]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I’m an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he’s so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I’m fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece

[Chorus]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the powder
Till then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 3]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation
Well that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it I’m killing this shit
I know damn well y’all feeling this shit
I don’t need your pussy, bitch, I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I’m surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I’m driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting
(So excit-, so excit-, so excit-, so excit-)

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
I’m letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
I’m letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told, I told, ayy-ayy, I told you
Up in the mornin', miss you bad
Sorry I ain't call you back, same problem my father had
All this time, all he had, all he had
And what he dreamed, all his cash
Market crashed, hurt him bad
People get divorced for that
Dropped some stacks, pops is good
Mama passed in Hollywood
If you ask, lost my soul
Drivin' fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm comin' back
I'll be takin' all the stacks, oh

[Verse 2: Desiigner & Kanye West]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta

Hittin' off licks in the bando
Takin' all the stacks, oh

White X6 looks like a panda
Stacks, oh

Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom

[Chorus: Kanye West & Desiigner]
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I (hey)
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I (Panda)
Panda, panda, panda, panda
Takin' all the stacks, oh
Panda, panda, panda
Stacks, oh

[Verse 3: Desiigner & Kanye West]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twist the dope, lean and shit, sippin' Fanta
Stacks, oh
Credit cards and the scammers
Wake up Versace, shit life Desiigner
Takin' all the stacks, oh
Whole bunch of lavish shit
They be askin' 'round town who be clappin' shit

I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti, whip look how I try this shit
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, killin' on camera

[Bridge: Caroline Shaw]
How can I find you?
Who do you turn to?
How do I bind you?

[Outro: Pastor T. L. Barrett]
If I don't turn to you
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

 

[Produced by Cashmere Cat and Sinjin Hawke]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
That you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
Love you, got to
Love you, love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost in... my doubt

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessy?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly so high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
Well, I found me, oh, Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I need you now
Lost and found out

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"
(What if Mary) "What if Mary
(Was in the club) was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
(And she was) We surrounded by
(Surrounded by) the fuckin' wolves"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find
Yeah I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off

Run away fast as you can

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Run away from me, baby, run away
Run away from me, baby, run away
When it starts to get crazy, why can't she just, run away?
Baby, I got a plan, run away fast as you can

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me

See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, "Don't text me, ho"
Told you four times, "Don't test me, ho"
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh Indian
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
And I...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up

And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me

[Hook: Kanye West + (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 1]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm."
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 2]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his?!

[Hook: Kanye West + (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 3]
Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

[Hook: Kanye West + (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down

"Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth

[Intro]
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

[Hook]
I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning

[Hook]
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up, Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit—I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions"
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's our cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
Ain't no way I'm givin' up. I'm a god

 

[Intro]
Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are
G-g-g-good work, Charlie
(Perfect!)

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(You!)

[Verse 1]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man, you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man, they would have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man, they would have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk, they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', now y'all get the message?!
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (You!)
Ten-thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (You!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (You!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Sonic boom!)

[Verse 2]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
I give 'em Grey Poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for, huh?
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (You!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (You!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah, ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2

[Outro]
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Perfect!)

[Intro - Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My Momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, "Back in my day"
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Outro: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
(I'm serious nigga, I got money)

[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Verse: Kanye West]
Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch, you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
"When it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma

[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh, I wanna phone home

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Outro: Justin Vernon and Kanye West]
I heard you need a new fad (a new girl)
I heard you need a new stack (a new girl)
I heard you need a new phone (a new girl)
I know your 'rents ain't be home (a new girl)

[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh, I wanna phone home

 

[Intro: Shirley Ann Lee]
Some day, some day
Some day I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Some day, some day, some day
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Some day, some days, I remembered this on a Sunday
Back way, yeah, way, way, burning, mhm-mhm
Uh, some days, not gonna please everybody
Some days I wanna hit the red dot on everybody
Some days, ohh (Heatstroke)
Now that I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana
Now that I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Some day we gon' set it off
Some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what we had in mind
But maybe some day

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

[Outro: 070 Shake]
Woah, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Bridge: Assassin]
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting a-dat man do
Action ting, yo, a badman ting

[Verse 2: Assassin]
I'm a badman if you know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way José
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's right, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like a aerosol can
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We a gon' smile 'pon court day
Becuh we beat murder charge like O.J

That’s right, I’m in it

That’s right, I’m in it
(Well, you need to fight for your own)
That’s right, I’m in it

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

[Hook 2: Assassin, Justin Vernon, and Kanye West]
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out

That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting

Say you long for me, for you
Lay it off with all your rules
Star fucker

[Outro: Kanye West]
Time to take it too far now
Uh, Michael Douglas out the car now
Uh, got the kids-and-the-wife life
Uh, but can't wake up from the nightlife
Uh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uh, being led by the drums
Uh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uh, gettin' head by the nuns
Uh, they don't play what I'm playin'
Uh, they don't see what I'm sayin'
Uh, they be ballin' in the D-League

[Intro: Kanye West]
Whose fault?

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 1: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Rubbin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl"
You'll probably find one of them "I like art"-type girls
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude: Kanye West]
"Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely" - Chloe Mitchell

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing

["The Best Birthday": Chris Rock]
Ohh my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another mother fucking level!
Now a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
God damn, God damn!
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you God damn disgusting!
My, my God, where'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you mother fucking butt ass naked...
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on...
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level!
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now! Shit!
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it...
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how... how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before!
I was in there like "Oh, shit! I never been here before!
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before!"
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'mma thank him. I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker, I'm-a shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch!
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
Even with the bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted!
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source!
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source!
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well

Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I’ve foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I’m in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said “take them glasses off and get in the pool”
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don’t believe in yesterday
And what’s a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m coming after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, it's like that y'all
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can’t live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1]
As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

[Hook]
Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

[Hook]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

[Bridge]
So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

[Hook]
Hello my only one,  just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me...

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven’t; the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful—blasted-boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children; zip it; listen

[Hook: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

[Hook: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

[Hook: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(Saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Hook: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout "how my neck look?"
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow

[Bridge: Sampha]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

[Verse 3: Sampha]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

Yup, Swag King Cole, yup

[Hook: Kanye West]
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you motherfuckers it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

[Hook: Kanye West]
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the building, we still keep it basement
Flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you
G.O.O.D. Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, let me ask this quest'

[Hook: Kanye West]
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some Theraflu
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh) Get the Theraflu
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh) Get the Theraflu
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh) Get the Theraflu

[Outro: DJ Pharris]
This Chicago, nigga
South Side, we in this bitch
East Side crazy, blow that loud
Low End, 39th, The Ickes

Stony Island, K-Town, Wild 100's
This Chi-Town, Dro City, The Village
Harvey World, O Block, 64th and Normal
64th and King Drive, what up?
83rd, Cottage Grove, the Gardens
This Chicago nigga!
The Dearborns, 55th, Cabrini-Green

This DJ Pharris, fuck around and get embarrassed

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh, uh
I love it though
I love it though, y'know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I’m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it’s rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I’m looking at her like this what you really wanted, huh?
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I’m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
(Satan, Satan, Satan)
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When the sun go down it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don’t leave while you're hot that’s how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme", not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven’t said a word- Haven’t said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

[Instrumental Interlude: Mike Dean Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping Rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that not when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique appetite's had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings never stumble, retracing my steps

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Hook: Kanye West & CyHi]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil, so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

[Hook: CyHi]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yuugh!

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 4: CyHi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Hook: RZA]
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh?

All of the lights, lights, all of the lights

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Post-Chorus: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are (all of the lights)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I’ll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know, yeah
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know, yeah
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own

[Verse 3: Fergie, (Rihanna), & Drake]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
(We going all the way this time)
We going all the way this time

[Chorus: Choir]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Outro: Alicia Keys & (Elton John)]
Whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh)
Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tell you but all I could say)

 

[Hook: Syleena Johnson + Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair."
‘Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, ‘cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Hook: Syleena Johnson + Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this."
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Hook: Syleena Johnson + Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Hook: Syleena Johnson + Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare, myself, myself

[Verse 1]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
Is he gon' make it? TBD, huh

I done died and lived again on DMT, huh
See, this a type of high that won't come down
This the type of high that get you gunned down
Yeezy, Yeezy trollin' OD, huh

Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too
I'ma pray for him 'cause he got MeToo'd
Thinkin' what if that happened to me too
Then I'm on E! News

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself

[Verse 2]
Ayy, hospital band a hundred bands, fuck a watch
Hundred grand'll make your best friends turn to opps
I hear y'all bringin' my name up a lot
Guess I just turned the clout game up a notch
See, y'all really shocked, but I'm really not
You know how many girls I took to the titty shop?
If she get the ass with it, that's a 50 pop
I still bring the bad bitches in the city out
Uh, just a different type of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke with Wiz Khalifa, uh
Told my wife I've never seen her
After I hit it, bye Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it up

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See, this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye!
Fuck what they talk about!
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds, ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Ask your homegirl right now, "Look, you had a shot at Ye?"
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
You'd drop everything!

[Verse 3]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
This is why your bitches fuck with me, huh
Smash, she gon' end up on TV, huh
Last thing that you ever wanna see, huh
I can feel the spirits all around me
I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me
They know I got demons all on me
Devil been tryna make an army
They been strategizin' to harm me
They don't know they dealin' with a zombie
Niggas been tryna test my Gandhi
Just because I'm dressed like Abercrombie

[Outro]
You see? You see?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
That's why I fuck with Ye!
See, that's my third person!
That's my bipolar shit, nigga, what?
That's my superpower, nigga, ain't no disability
I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!
Agghhh!

High lights

Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Young Thug]
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, oh no
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo (slow motion)
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro

[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights

Livin' the life 'til I die

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I bet me and Ray J would be friends
If we ain't love the same bitch
Yeah, he might have hit it first
Only problem is I'm rich
Uh, 21 Grammys, superstar family
We the new Jacksons, I'm all about that action
I'm about that Farrakhan, life is a marathon
I'ma shift the paradigm, I'ma turn up every time
I'ma bust a coach's head open on some Diddy shit
If he ever talk to my son like an idiot
One time for a nigga really gettin' it
Two times cause we got the whole city lit
Advice to all my niggas: impregnate Bridget
So when she have a baby she gon' make another nigga
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches hah?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian hah?
She spent her whole check on some Christians
And that girl ain't even religious
Walkin', livin', breathin' god, you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Blac Chyna fuckin' Rob, help him with the weight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back
What you want?
You want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack?
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not

[Outro: The-Dream]
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not

I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
Bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
Oh lord, oh my lord

[Intro: Francis and the Lights & Kanye West]
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say "don't say this, don't say that"
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

[Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say he died so young
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay

 

[Intro: Arthur Russell]
Baby lion goes
Where the islands go

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ándale ándale E.I, E.I, uh-oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though

[Chorus: Kanye West]
But I still drove 30 hours
And I, I still drove 30 hours to you, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I drove back 30 hours

[Bridge: Arthur Russell]
Were remains that long to lose sad
Better unsaid
Always turn, oh

[Outro: Kanye West & André 3000]

[Intro: 070 Shake]
Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Verse: Kanye West]
Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
I'm saying it like…
I want a daughter like Nicki, aw, man, I promise
I'ma turn her to a monster, but no ménages
I don't know how you saying it but, let 'em hear this

 

[Intro: Kanye West]
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!

[Hook: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
‘Cause I'm comin' home again
(Min' home again)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, lil homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees."
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tore 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat ‘cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown, in
The nighttime her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me."
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!"

[Hook: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
(Min' home again)
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you," and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

[Hook: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
(Min' home again)
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again
(Min' home again)
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Comin' home again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

 

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Kanye West]
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't...

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say, "Build your own"—I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice"—they said, "How, Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say we 'bout to lose it all
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Bridge: Jeremih]
And I sometimes wish
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than this
Yes, you know you're one of these
We can run through with the top chopped, yeah
And the sundress down, ooh

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental
We had an incident, but I cover incidentals
You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again
Then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Chorus: Choir, PARTYNEXTDOOR & Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't feel like she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin (out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (uhh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (love me or hate me)

[Outro: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
For any guy that ever fucked up (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (ohh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testin' her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
"For better or for worse", huh?
For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Hook: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Hook]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to work
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Hook: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Hook]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Hook: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Outro Over Hook]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said
"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"
"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"
You can't be serious, man

[Verse 1]
Yeezy season approachin'
Fuck whatever y'all been hearin'
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearin'
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran, hah!

[Chorus]
On sight, on sight

[Bridge]
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up

[Interlude]
He'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want

[Verse 2]
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped 'em both down
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin'
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth

[Chorus]
On sight, on sight

[Interlude]
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

[Outro]
Right now
I need right now

 

[Intro]
Flashing lights, lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights, lights

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like "love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

[Hook: Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know?
Flashing lights, lights, lights
What do I know? Know
Flashing lights, lights, lights

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thang
I know it was foul, baby
Aye, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

[Hook: Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know?
Flashing lights, lights, lights
What do I know? Know
Flashing lights, lights, lights

[Outro: Dwele]
As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know?
Flashing lights, lights, lights
What do you know? Know
Flashing lights, lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights, lights, lights, lights…

 

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend – well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Outro]
On and on and on and on
And on and... and on and on and on

Maybe it's 'cause she into Leos and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio couldn't have helped
It's gettin' cold, better bring your ski clothes
Peekin' through the keyhole, the door locked by myself
And I'm feelin' it right now
'Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah, I'm rockin' Chewbacca

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
Cause they don't fucking

[Kanye]
I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast motherfucker!

[Hook: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

[Hook: Kanye West]
Now I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them

Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and

This is the last call for alcohol, for the

So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
"Oh my god, is that a black card?"
I turned around and replied, "Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express"
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips

[Hook: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the

So get your ass up off the wall

"... last call for alcohol, for my niggas"

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the "Truth" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin?" I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay."
Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with

So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, "Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"

No ID: "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"

[Saxophone Solo]

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that "Truth" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with a sped up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't be Life."

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude."

[Jay-Z: "Oh you a real soulful dude, man"]

And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[Jay-Z: "Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"]

"Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?"

[Jay-Z: "so what you think of this?"]

And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Mother: "Come on, let's just go"]

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

[Mother: "Kanye, baby, we're here"]

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City." And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye."

[Dame: "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"]

"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats"

[Dame: "Jay got classics, G."]

You know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said "man that was tight."

[Jay-Z: "That, that was cool. That was hot."]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say "naw." Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: "Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."]

I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up

["Y'all niggas is stupid"]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: "We gonna change the game, buddy."]

Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack."

[Dame: "You gotta make sure it's not wack."]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."

Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like "oh shit"

[Dame: "Oh shit it's not even wack."]

"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."

[Dame: "it's actually kinda hot."]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"

[Dame: "you don't wanna catch a brick"]

"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on." I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer rapper," and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"

[Mel: "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"

So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...

 

[Verse 1: Quavo]
(Quavo!)
Lifestyle on camera
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier
They tried to turn me to an animal
But white people think I'm radical
Supermodels think I'm handsome
You might think I'm too aggressive
But really I think I'm too passive
'Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin'

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Pray for me
I'm about to hit the Ye button
I don't wanna say nothin' wrong
But it'd be wrong if I ain't say nothin'
Imagine if I ain't say somethin'
Wouldn't none these niggas say nothin'
I done lost and made money
Now I'm makin' somethin' they can't take from me
And I'm fresh out of debt in this mothafucka!
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka!
Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on
I'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci!
Fresh out the feds in this mothafucka
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka
Gucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on
Now that Gucci home, it's over for you Gucci clones

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go (straight up)

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Look, I say a prayer for my enemies
They cannot slow down what's meant for me
Funny how they come around like I can't see through they secret identities
Lately, it's all about Zen in me
Subtractin' the negative energy
Fuck with the family, turn your ass to a memory
My niggas keep it a century
I blow the check up, nigga, detonation
Kill 'em one by one, Final Destination
Top my destination
I got guardian angels all around a nigga, that's deflectin' Satan
I'm a mothafuckin' champion
This right here the fuckin' anthem
I can't dap you without hand san'
I don't know where your dirty ass hands been
I wake up to like a hundred texts
Championship team, but we can't cut the net
She all off in my jersey lookin' underdressed
I'm finna buy this bitch a Honda CRX
With...

[Chorus: Travis Scott + Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole

[Verse 5: 2 Chainz]
I took a nap in the pulpit
I never like how a suit fit
I got a pocket full of money
It got me walkin' all slew-foot
I'm on my wave like a cruise ship
In that hoe mouth like a toothpick
Anyone get in my way
Nothin' to say, I tote 'em choppas like pool sticks
I wear pajamas to Ruth's Chris
Couldn't walk a mile in my new kicks
I'm comin' from the apartments
We never had our damn pool fixed
Walk in the mall with my new bitch
Tell her to get the whole rack
My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch
Then pull me a new bitch
See that is a snowball effect
I got gold on my neck
Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck
I got a mansion full of marble floors
It look like I could go bowl in this bitch
Versace logos on bowls in this bitch
Like I'm a serial killer
I put the real in gorilla
I did this shit for my niggas

[Chorus: Travis Scott + Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
I'm Yo Gotti!
Reach for my chain is suicide
The car I drive fit two inside
They mad at Ye 'cause he all in the neighborhood
But he let them goons inside
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Buy every house in this bitch
You know that the money good
My wrist in the kitchen go 'round and 'round
Play with the kid, I'ma gun you down
The roof on that Wraith in the lost and found
Official trap shit let me slow it down
Way more shit than a Pamper
All we rock is bandanas
Whips so nasty, no manners
I just got head in a Phantom

[Verse 7: Gucci Mane]
She say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ
She say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp
1017's the Squad, Gucci Mane's the stamp
And he don't never sleep, he's a fuckin' vamp
I heard your bitch ride on the bus, you don't give a damn
My bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am
I love my Auntie Jane, but fuck Uncle Sam
I'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram
Niggas never test the kid so I don't have to cram
My city treat me like a king, I should wear a crown
And I don't really fuck around
I gave my bitch two mil' 'cause she stuck around

[Chorus: Travis Scott + Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole

Uhh.. uhh
Uhh.. uhh
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 1]
Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation

[Hook]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 2]
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

[Hook]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 3]
Good morning, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

[Outro: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down

[Intro: Beenie Man]
Relivin' the past?
Your loss!

[Verse 1: King Louie]
Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey how I make the pain improve

[Chorus: King Louie]
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This the cray-ist shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin' close to him
Yeezus just rose again

[Chorus: King Louie]
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down

[Outro: Beenie Man]
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have

 

[Intro]
We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves

[Chorus]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)

[Verse 1]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope

[Chorus]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid cause we ain't spoke in so long
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid cause we ain't spoke in so long
So long, so long
(Jesus walk with me)

[Verse 2]
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

[Chorus]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) I'm good

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Welcome to the good life, where niggas who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi
Ah! (Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!

[Bridge]
Yo, it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

[Hook: Kanye West & T-Pain]
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
(I'ma get on this TV momma, I'ma)
(I'ma put shit down)
Ayy (ayyy) ayy (ayyy)
Ayy (ayyy) ayy (I'm good)

[Verse 2: Kanye West & (T-Pain)]
Welcome to the good life!
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
'Cause they got mo' (ass than the models)
The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles
'Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C
It feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yay
Ay, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)
Homey tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood (Welcome to the good life)
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would (Welcome to the good life!)
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should (Welcome to the good life)
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

[Hook: Kanye West & T-Pain]
Now I, I go for mine, I gots to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
Now I, I go for mine, I gots to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
I'ma get on the TV momma, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) ayyy
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) I'm good

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
'Cause (the good life) I always had a passion for flashin'
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

[Outro: T-Pain]
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin me "baby"
If you feelin me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Heyy, heyy, ooooh I'm GOOD!

 

[Intro: Slick Rick]
Believe it or not
Believe it or not

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi]
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you

[Verse: Kanye West]
Take the top off, let the sun come in
Whoa, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (again)
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky-ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me
Hah? Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs, "Turn the snubs off!"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(Believe it or not) These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not) I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not) The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you, truth told, I like you
Too bold to type you, too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin!

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi]
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (make no)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (no way)
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (no way)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you

 

[Intro: Four Tops]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust

[Verse: Kanye West & T.I.]
I know Obama was heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be president
Yeah, you can, at what cost though?
Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?
Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk though
But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?
Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?
It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against
You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print
You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit
It's bigger than your selfish agenda
If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas
Then shit…
Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people
Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal
You gotta see the vantage point of the people
What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil
See that's the problem with this damn nation
All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man
We ain't made it off the plantation
Fuck who you choose as your political party
You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted
With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position
Don't you feel an obligation to them?
I feel a obligation to show people new ideas
And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here
Make America Great Again had a negative perception
I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction
Added empathy, care and love and affection
And y'all simply questionin' my methods
What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?
This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you
You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views
As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you
All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie
Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie
That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down
You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?
I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half
Then one day I was like, "Fuck it, I'ma do me."
I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me
Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up
Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up
The greater good of the people is first
Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?
You had a bad idea and you're makin' it worse
This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church
Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different
Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand
I know everybody emotional
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?
You'll deal with God for the lack of respect
Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check
Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that
What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?
Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bigot
Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget
And all that free thought shit, find a better defense
But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that
Fuck it

[Outro: Kanye West]
Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man
Why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

[Hook]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Post-Hook]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)

[Verse 2]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Hook 2]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

[Hook 2]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Outro]
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
Sky, sky high! I’m, I’m sky high!
Yeah, keep it rollin'!
Yeah, uh, feels good to be home, baby!
Feels good to be home!

Stuttering
Giving 'em rest and making love again
In my best, I be the run again
And I have the man dem stuttering, -ing

[Hook: Andrea Martin]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh!

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Yeah, ayo, ayo
Barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas watches is rough, grabbing our crotches
Yelling what up? The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see the smell, it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yelling Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock, I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock, yo?

[Hook: Andrea Martin]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh!

[Verse 2: Common]
I was born by a lake, chicken shack and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Godly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it
Could have been living it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
(Ohh!) Situation delicate

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up
So it's (ashes to ashes, dust to dust)
In God we trust, the game is all us
'Til the sky calls or it's flames on us
Push

[Hook: Andrea Martin]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh!

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
I'm chilling in my camo, flipping through the channel
On my G.O.O.D. Music shit, my logo's a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position

[Verse 5: Cyhi the Prynce]
I hope the people is listening
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickeling when I hear what haters be whispering
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Huh, fake friends and siblings
Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15, I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21, they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

[Bridge: Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
(Whooooa) Yeah, you feeling on top now
Getting that money nigga? (You, you sold your soul)
(Heeey) Yeah, you feeling on top now
(Heeey) Getting that money nigga? (You sold your soul)
(Whooooa) Yeah, you feeling on top now
Getting that money nigga?
(Heeey) Naw man, mad people was fronting
(Heeey) Aw man, made something from nothing

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. woulda been G.O.D. except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know
Some people call that the art of war, you know
I guess it depends what you falling for, the clothes?
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was fronting
Goddamn, we made something from nothing

 

[Hook]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'cause I'mma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

[Hook]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

[Hook]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church

[Hook]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get down

[Verse 4: Jay-Z and (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long? (Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong (The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter-chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'
Young the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive

Stadium status

[Hook]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out "Jigga"
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, "He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig"
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

[Hook]
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 2]
Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

[Hook]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, "New Jack City" got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'mma beat my brother
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, "I inspired me"
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, "Damn, no way"
Translate, español: "No way, José"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

[Bridge]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

[Hook]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name "Porsche" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later sein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, "Pssh, we messed up."
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen"
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Outro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)

 

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, "Life is like a box of chocolates"
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of "You Are So Beautiful To Me"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Bridge]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go our love is true
Mama mama mama mama mama...
Mama mama mama mama mama...

[Intro]
Wake up Mr. West - Mr. West - Mr. West...
Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea

[Verse 1]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars - I know it

[Hook: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Verse 2]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

[Hook: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Post-Hook: Adam Levine]
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Outro]
Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint
Make a nun cum, make her cremate
Move downtown, cop a sweet space
Livin’ life like we won the sweepstakes, what
We headed to hell for heaven’s sakes, huh
Well I’mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!

[Hook]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin’ from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It’s kinda crazy that’s all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

[Hook]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
One day I’m gon' marry a porn star
We’ll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We’ll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin’ to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I’mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin’ to on Oscar day
'specially if she can’t get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn’t rent her, they couldn’t take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, “Get away”
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

[Hook]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life

[Outro]
I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That’s one hell of a life

(Mmm, mmm, mmm)

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They're all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might desert me

[Hook: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey sample]
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryin' to get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight

[Hook: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey sample]
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dawg, "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yup, I got it from here, 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?
Ha ha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CD's
I'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man!
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear
Sayin' exactly what I've been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time
(I'm Young, bitches!) Good night!

[Hook]
Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right
A'ight?

[Hook]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

[Verse 2]
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?

[Hook]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

[Verse 3]
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about?
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you’ll ever find your dreams?

 

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus]
Yes I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little something, show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Verse 1]
You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say "when you see clothes, close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
Cause every summer, he'd get some
Brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus]
I think he did
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everything I wanted, man it seem so serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Verse 2]
When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Bridge]
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up stand up here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up stand up here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus]
Yes I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everybody want it, but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this... like this

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

The storm is on the horizon
I’m standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip and it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I’mma be here 'til it’s done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I’m the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I’m the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I’m the one

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm the one, baby, yeah, I'm the one, baby
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby
You on a run, baby, you on a run, baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mhm that's cool but I been runnin on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt, you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan - Michael Phelps
Yeah, had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip - yeaaaalm!

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
The storm is on the horizon

I told Detroit I'mma fuckin' get it
I told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'
Ye told me I'm the man for the job
So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'
Started off in that Chevrolet, but it's Ferraris I gotta drive
I'm on HBO with my entourage, I'm 5'9'' fuckin' 9 to 5
I need a hundred million no compromise, I'm a double X-L nigga
Magazine and condom size, see what I seen and be traumatized
I don't wait, I marinate, variate, everyday
Every state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade
My weed loud, I need a hearing aid
Livin' life behind a pair of shades
I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar
For all the bullshit that I hear a day
I did it

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
The storm is on the horizon

Treat the back seat like a sofa bed
Break bread with my niggas, call it profit sharing
This some good shit, but it get better
And yeah my bitch cold, nigga thin sweater
Like my verse suede and the beat leather
Just tryin' to stay above sea level
When my nigga went to jail, I said, "Free Gucci"
I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci
Bought my baby momma anaconda bags
I shouldn't have bought it all, I should've went and cut the grass
Snake ass niggas in my fuckin' face
Bring your girl here nigga so I could fuck her face
Yeah I run this place, this is cashmere swag
Niggas treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast
Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game
Louis on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Fuck yeah, awesome, yeah I lost some, of my mind
And then I found peace, it was really kind
Of awesome, it's possible, goddamn right
Yeah I've been honest the whole time
Fuck yeah, awesome, yeah I lost some, of my mind
And then I found peace, it was really kind
Of awesome, it's possible, goddamn right
Yeah I've been honest the whole time

[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture-perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was as black as the street was
I'll never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Hook] (DJ Premier scratches)
Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the N-nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 3]
I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today

[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
Talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Knowin', you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
I found you, oh Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
Amongst the yellow eyes

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessey
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Intro]
Wished I had told ooh was (the) only one (uh oh!)
But it's too late, it's too late he's gone

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You sweat her and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) groupies say I'm too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way

[Hook]
Gone we striving home
Gone I ride on chrome, it's too late

[Verse 2]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin' over babysitters like bitch it's yo turn
"Damn Ye it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official"
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with Doobie Long
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

[Hook]
We striving home
[Cam]
I ride on chrome
We striving home
[Cam]
Killa, I ride on chrome

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag niggas still doing puff-puff-pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell em
Hey back in a touched up Jag shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain’t even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, shit
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now

[Hook]
We striving home, I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me "Benz or Rover?"
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, "Sorry, Mr. West is gone"

 

[Spoken Word: Kelly Price]
You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good he's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about him
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body I love him so much
Because he's done so much for me. 
Every morning
Every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up
By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there, because he...
He's gonna be there for me
Some day the sky above will open up
And he will reach out  his hand and guide me through
Oh yes he will
I won't always be crying these tears
I won't always be feeling so blue
Some day, he will open up the door for me
And call my name
Some day he will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.
No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been he's always there
With his arms open wide
Accepting me
For who I am
And I love him so much
I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to
I'm crying now
It feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
Oh lord thank you
You are the joy of my life.

[Hook]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye
Let's put him all in the front of the store
So I'm on break, next to the "No Smoking" sign
With a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writing my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle, you can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude, lock yourself in a room
Doing 5 beats a day for 3 summers
That's A Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!"
So many records in my basement
I'm just waiting on my spaceship

[Hook]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Verse 2: GLC]
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob, at the same time
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
Life my love, that's not mine
"Why you ain't signed?" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball, never one to fall
Got to get mine, got to take mine
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime
Got to make these haters respect mine
In the mall until 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves, waiting patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holla at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, staying low key, nope
Holler at God, "Man why'd you have to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people counting on me
And I'm just trying to find my peace
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!
(Aww, man, this pressure)

[Hook]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Verse 3: Consequence]
I remember having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Trying to make this thing right
And having one of my co-workers say "Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I had all that snatched from me
A&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

[Hook]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Outro: Tony Williams]
I want to fly, I want to fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me, brother, for a ride

 

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro]
Oh yeah...
I've got the perfect song for the kids to sing...

[Hook]
And all my people that's...
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 1]
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats, man, man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, "Next summer, I'm finna"
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown

[Hook]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 2]
The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work
He figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake
And "we don't care what people say"

[Hook]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 3]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions"
We scream: "rocks, blow, weed, park", see, now we smart
We ain't retards, the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare, they tryna put me on the school bus
With the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But "we don't care what people say," my niggas

[Hook]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

 

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, I made up in my mind (ohhhh)

Middle finger to the sky tonight (Ay, ay, ay)
The whole world is a couch
Bitch I'm Rick James tonight (I don't give a fuck)
Throw it up (ay) throw it up (ay) cause you can't take it with you
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world (ay) to the world (ay) then I'm on my Sinatra
I'm doing it my way, let's take it a notch up
Take it u-u-u-up

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
To the world, I made up in my mind (ohhhh)
Doing things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight
I'm doing things my way (ohhhh)
It's my way or the highway, let me say it one more time
Middle fingers up to the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Mmm ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs
Like, these niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back, I'm just tryna protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at?
"Ease up there, baby boy": Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap, shitting on you, holy crap

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
To the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld
To the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon
Hills to the mountains, yeah, hands to the roof
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me

 

[Intro]
How's your son? (all the things)
He made the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough
(...all all that glitters is not gold
And all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me)
Ma we here we gon' cook this Sunday ok?
That's a new girlfriend?

[Verse 1]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet like a photo
Of your granny's picture, now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, "This Can't Be Life"
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

[Hook]
And I don't care 'bout
(all the diamond rings all the diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight and gold
(all that glitters is not gold, now gold is not reality)
Now all I know I know all these things
(real is what you lease on me)

[Verse 2]
This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV!"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit 3 in the bed if it's 6 of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

[Interlude]
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

[Verse 3]
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family, dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
You can still love your man and be manly, dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storm out then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business

[Hook]
(all all all the diamond rings diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
(all all that glitters is not gold, now gold is not reality)
They don't mean a thing a thing
(all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing a thing a thing
I don't care what they don't mean a thing
(all, all, all the things) all these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight and gold
All I know, I know all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things

[Outro]
CLK Mercedes Benz
All these things, all these things ...
All these things, all these things ...
All these things, all these things ...
A whole lotta money
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
Mommy and Daddy, will you please stop fighting?
All these things, all these things
All these things, (and I don't care why) all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things...
Let's get Stevie outta jail

[Hook]
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 1]
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes?
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up

[Hook]
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 2]
We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems, baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass?
You like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying, baby, you have changed
'Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
'Cause even when we're kissing, baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like, "No he didn't?
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Trying to get a pair of Christians?"
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say, "How is work, baby?"
Well, some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe, I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign
I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign
Now, she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd
Talk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote, "'Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends"
On the phone, hollin' that "Niggas is whatever"
Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her, "Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress"
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no, that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor, "Just drive so far"
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
Well, we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb 'cause we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herbs, go somewhere in private
I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot, uh

[Hook]
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, SYSTEM OVERLOAD
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—you lose
You lose
You lose
You lose
You lose

 

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat

[Hook: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again
Keep 'em high

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
N-n-n-now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcohol-ics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
'Til I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna fol-low my heart
And if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke, but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes
That's why we hear your music in fast forward
'Cuz we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'

[Hook: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again
Keep 'em high

[Verse 2: Kanye West + Sumeke Rainey]
("You've got mail!") N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this
E-mailing me at 11:26?
Telling me that she 36-26, plus double-d
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T-E, it's getting late mami
Your screen saver say tweet, so you got to "call me"
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
(You mean Talib? Lyrics sticks to your rib)
I mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lyin')
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high! Owwww!

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Yo, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes
But never mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
And sister's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or trying to get off cigarettes?
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
Now I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it

[Verse 4: Common]
Yo, yo
Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
Control rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me
They say Hip-Hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year, it's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper
Just an emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

[Hook: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again
Keep 'em high

 

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

[Hook: Kanye West]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

[Hook: Kanye West]
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

[Hook: Kanye West]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
I'm amazing (amazing) yeah I'm all that (all that)
If I ain't on my grind, then what you call that? (What you call that?)
Victorious, yeah we warriors
We make history, strive off victory (yeah)
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure, either let the Feds catch ya (yeah)
I'm amazing, born on a full moon
I was bred to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goon, summertime, no June
Big family, small house, no room
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard?
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"

[Outro: Kanye West]
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing

My hat, my shoes, my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace
That's Louis Vuitton, bitch
I think Hennessy, I drink, I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona. I'm zonin'
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
In two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And hey, please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers
While y'all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game, rock a chain 'steada wedding ring
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when 'Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And, oh yeah, Yeezy

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What am I supposed to do now?
Man the game all messed up
How I'm suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a Speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind, the empty bottles of No-Doz
Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost?
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends
Yeah, the dark skin'ed ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?
I know, I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to B.I.G
Any one: Big Pun, Big L or Notorious
'Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
Yeah I'mma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir (with backing vocals from John Legend]

I know you see me now, right now
I know you see me now, right now (you see, you see)
I know you see me now, right now (haha, yeah)
I know you see me now, right now

[Bridge 1: Beyoncé & Kanye West]
I got my suit and tie, and I don’t know if y’all know
Well maybe y’all do, or maybe y’all don’t
But I don’t really care, it’s how we on it all the time
So I’ma get my money, let’s go

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, uh
Now I’ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I’m Socrates, but my skin more chocolatey
What’s up with who? That’s old news
I’m in a speedboat in my boat shoes
Hah? I swear my whole collection’s so cruise
I might walk in Nobu wit' no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you"
Immature adult, insecure asshole
And if you fall on the concrete, that’s your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that’s your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass low
She got a big booty, but she couldn’t drop that ass low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin' money, they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money, cops don’t let a nigga pass Go
Straight to jail yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'em I said "Hello"
Ask if I’ma be there soon and tell him I said “Hell no”
Yo, what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé & (Kanye West)]
My niggas is home
I guess I got everything, everything I want
(Let's go shopping, dog, let's celebrate)
But I don’t, no matter how good it gets, it’ll never be like before
(Free Weezy though)
No women in the crowd, screamin' and it’s loud
Doin' things not allowed and I swear it’s going down right now
(You know what it is)
I know one thing, my mama would be proud
And you see me lookin' up
'Cause I know she’s lookin' down right now

[Hook: Charlie Wilson]
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I’m in the Louvre, lookin' for fossils
'Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells, it’s so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barneys
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic: 32
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin' that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child’s illusions become reality

[Bridge 3: Beyoncé & Kanye West]
Now go get my throne, 'cause I don’t wanna stop
I just go in my zone, and I’ma make it hot 'til it’s time to go
When it’s time to go, where you tryna go?
You better act like you can see me now

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Exactly
Rosewood
Aha, aha
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Man, today I am the freshest in the world, but that's the obvious
Damn, I look so sexy, and you look like a pile of shit
When I told my ex I love her, she went and married another
And changed her whole name up, you a Yugoslavi' chick
"Be successful," that's what Dad told me
So everything I D-O, now I OD
They say G.O.O.D. Music like the new Miami Heat, shit
Comparin' them to us, man they gotta add Kobe
Whoadie, holy moley went, from G-Shockin' to Rollie
From the D, coppin' in Beverly Hills, I'm Axel Foley
Nah, nah, baby boy, you Jody, in the party, they all know me
Yeah, I saw your ass in line, boy, you was lookin' like the old me
Presidential suit, my girls Michelle and Chanel
She gave me designer, uh, she keep it au natural
I say it again, I'm chasin' cheese, dodgin' rat traps
Chasin' pussy you might end up with a Kat Stacks
Nasty trick, you's a nasty chick
Ooh, you know I like that nasty shit
Got it made in every way, gettin' paid every day
What Sean sound like, 'Ye protégé?
He sound like he a pro to me
"I know Kanye a jerk," how could you say that?
He rode me and my mama 'round in his Maybach
What kind of jerk is that? What kind of jerks is y'all?
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off
Bet you take it off or chase him through the mall
We workin' twice as hard, so everything come in twos
Double drinks, double girls
We be gettin' paid like W-2
Rep Westside, throwin' up Ws
"We love you Sean," I love you too
Ooh-ooh, you know I do

[Outro: Kanye West]
Hey, feel like one of those old R. Kelly joints, right?
I bet they put me back on the cover of Ebony now
I know Jet magazine calling right now
You looking good today too, I like that
You got your new suit on and she got the extra cute on
I know you thinking, “This that Yeezy we all love”
I’m back, baby, we back, baby
Uncle Charlie, by the way
And I’ma let you finish, but I got Beyoncé on the track
That’s what it is
Black excellence, baby

We the greatest in the world baby, we the greatest in the world!!!
Hahahahaha
Yeah, Lex Luger, No ID, Yeezy

Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

[Hook: Kanye West]
It's been a week without me

Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!

Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit girl, I'll still hit girl
1 and, you brought 2 friends, ok, 3 more now hop in the Benz
4-door: do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8?
All the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

[Hook: Kanye West]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Bridge: Kanye West]
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, what, huh?
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, huh?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I’m in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too, I’m a freak, boo
I’m wildin', I’m on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'?

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me skip across that stage in five dozen, yuuugh
Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute rhyme
Let's be clear and let's be fair
The best thing in music’s bein' offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still givin' you it all like the coffin's near

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep

[Verse 3: Ryan Leslie]
It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave ya
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me Les but they all need more of me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Uhh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, uh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin' now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talking, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Ywah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine
Sits pretty in my palm, Chandon as we continue on

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Verse 5: Kid Cudi]
Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my boney wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when– let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living
Haters copy, I'm the image, hey
Haters copy, I'm the image

[Hook: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

[Hook: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

[Hook: Kanye West & GLC]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie
Live today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby it's evident
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

[Hook]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie

 

[Intro]
I need you, I want you to

[Verse 1]
You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
You got a sister-in-law you'd smash? I got four of 'em
Damn, those is your sisters
You did somethin' unholy to them pictures
Damn, you need to be locked up
Nah, we need a bigger hot tub

[Chorus]
Now let me see you back, back, back, back
Time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
She got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all this on Ecstasy

[Verse 2]
You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
You remember bad bitches that you smashed? I recorded 'em
She said "fuck weed" 'cause she love X
If she suck seed, that's a success
If a girl cum, that's a fuck fest
And we gon' score 100 on this drug test

[Chorus]
Now let me see you back, back, back, back
It's time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
You got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all this on Ecstasy (perfect!)

[Interlude]
Fuckin' 'round—whoop, scoop!
Whoopity-whoop
Whoopity-whoop, scoop-poop-woop-toop
Scoopity-whoop loot, looty-whoop-whoop
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy (uh, uh)

[Verse 3]
You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
Haaan? Scoop!
You see them escorts? I escorted 'em, scoopity-woot!
While y'all was trippin', I resorted 'em, whoop!
Then I kicked 'em out, I got bored of them, whoop!

[Chorus]
Now let me see you back, back, back, back
It's time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
You got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all this on Ecstasy

[Outro]
Ecstasy

[Intro: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Re-Up Gang Pusha
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (yes!)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil’s angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses
Couldn’t cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch, have my son before I face that tragedy
Uhh, I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse, gone!

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (yeah, yeah)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don’t judge me, uh, for the followin'
Fat bitches swallowin', skinny bitches modellin'
Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunch-y
The devil stay testing, cause when you chase the pussy
It’s a sin, but if it falls in your lap, it’s a blessin'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressin'
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers

[Verse 3: Cyhi the Prynce]
CyHi! Yeah! Boy, we lookin’ for trouble
Maybe if we wasn’t black, then we wouldn’t have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got 20 pounds of kush in the duffle
So I’m runnin through them circles boy, I’m lookin like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings so trust me, dawg, I’m good for a scuffle
Don’t be mad I whooped your ass cause I’ve tooken a couple
Feds askin' niggas questions, but I wouldn’t rebuttal
'Cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Huh, royal flush so kiss my royal nuts
Ain’t nothin’ silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now I’m eatin’ off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

[Interlude: Big Sean & Kanye West]
G.O.O.D., I do it
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
B-I-G, Sean Don, nigga
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (bitch!)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
I’m in, that no-smoke sec' rolling motherfucking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you’re not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G stashed in my trousers
New double D's smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo ass just finished the poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay or Drizzy Drake?
Meanwhile I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dyin'
Greet me with a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool cause I can’t see yo ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice him
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m 'sposed to run?
Yo bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Hmm, fuck it, e’rybody can get it
When you’re this hot, e'rybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high, e'rybody’s a midget
All this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothin'
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from, quarter to broke to half past rich
With my badass bitch, and you don’t want no problems
On some math class shit so check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiendin' ’bout
What you been praying fo'? What you been screamin' ’bout?
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout

 

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
The rings all ring out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
We found out

 

[Verse 1]
Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleep (less in June) or (missing you)

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

[Verse 2]
Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

[Verse 3]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will

[Verse 4]
I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will

[Instrumental Outro]

 

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all I got was a brand new sports car, oh

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it

[Interlude: Kanye West]
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
My god-sister getting married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it

[Outro: Kanye West]
And I and I can't stop
No, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, I can't stop
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it

 

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Is this thing on?
Oh, I thought they silenced us, Ye
Power to the people

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
We living in that 31st century, futuristic fly shit
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private
New watches (you know what time it is) watch us (you see us)
They can’t stop us, the prophets, biatches!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
No one man should have all that power

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Rumble, young man, rumble
Life is a trip, so sometimes we gonna stumble
You gotta go through pain in order to become you
But once the world numbs you, you’ll feel like it’s only one you
Now you got the power to do anything you want to
Until you ask yourself, "Is this what it’s all come to?"
Looking at life through sunglasses and a sunroof
But do you have the power to get out from up under you
Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you
They're trying to Axl Rose you, welcome to the jungle
To be continued, we on that Norman Mailer shit
In search of the truth even if it goes through Taylor Swift
Tell her this

[Chorus: Kanye West & John Legend]
No one man should have all that power
Yea-ey-yea-ey-yeah-ey!
Oh oh (and they say) yeah-ey (and they say)
Oh oh (and they say) yeah-ey (and they say)
Oh oh (and they say) yeah-ey (and they say)
No one man should have all that power

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Now when I walk in, everybody do the "Power" clap
Clap, clap, clap
Fresh for the club, I just took a half an hour nap
Clap, clap, clap
I seen people go crazy when the whole world in our lap
Clap, clap, clap
My socket was out the plug now it’s time to get the power back
Clap, clap

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I seen people abuse power, use power
Misuse and then lose power
Power to the people at last, it’s a new hour
Now we all ain't gonna be American Idols
But you can least grab a camera, shoot a viral, huh
Take the power in your own hands
I’m a grown man, doing my grown dance
I don’t stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch
I’m on my Van Gogh, I don’t hear shit

[Chorus: Kanye West & John Legend]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours (ey-yeah!)
Oh oh (and they say) yeah-ey (and they say)
Oh oh (and they say) yeah-ey (and they say)
Oh oh (and they say) yeah-ey (and they say)
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (the power)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Now everything I’m rhyming on cause a Ramadan
Been a don, praying for the families lost in the storm
Bring our troops back from Iraq, keep our troops out of Iran
So the next couple bars, I’mma drop 'em in Islam
They say "As-salamu alaykum", say "Wa alaikum as-salaam"
That’s no Oscar Mayer bacon, you should run and tell your mom
Now the question is, how we going stop the next Vietnam
Keep Flex out of Korea, cause you know he drop bombs

[Break: Swizz Beatz]
Showtime!
Aiyyo Yeezy, man, stop playing with these people, man
They want see you act all crazy in this motherfucker, man
Take that jacket off and go crazy on them niggas, man
You know what I’m talking about? (I got the power!)

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
What do it mean to be the boss?
It mean second place is the first one who lost
The crucifixion, the being nailed to the cross
Truth or fiction, it’s a hell of a cost
Do the dishes, I’m about to hit that Jeff Gordon
Michael Jordan, the only one more important
But I be feeling like Jordan when I’m recording
Cause every time I record, I dunk and slap the boards
I don’t know what these rappers gonna do afterwards
Prolly spaz like I might do at the awards
Huh, I got the whole crowd going crazy
Homie, I should be rewarded
Gettin' money, Yeezy, Yeezy, how you do it, huh
Eating Wheaties, drinkin' Fiji, being greedy, huh
Don’t even think you can allude to the rumors
I’m immune to the boos, I’ma prove to you losers
It’s all in timing, nigga
See I dreamed my whole life that I could rhyme with Jigga
Now Jay my big brother and Bey' my lil' sister
And excuse me, but you can’t see my lil' sister
Number one sound across the board, hey
Number one now and forevermore, hey
Number one rule is niggas don’t hate
Maybe I’ll drop the album, nah, y’all gotta wait
And on the net, they showing pictures of my Cali place
My Maybach in NY but it still got the Cali plates
All my old girls know that I’m the one that got away
I think about 'em Christmas and play some Donny Hathaway
And keep my bulletproof-hater coat on
Looking at some photos that I’m looking crazy dope on
Hand up, talking shit, yeah, I get my Pope on
And go home with something to poke on
That’s what Dre said, but this what 'Ye said
How 'Ye doing? Who 'Ye screwin'?
That’s for my dick to know, before you get to know him
She ain’t give you ass, that pussy fictional
I gotta give her the eviction no-
-tice, "Get yo’ ass out, bitch, vamonos"
Five seconds to the song and we getting close
I got the power, motherfucker, if you didn’t know

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Chill, chill, chill, man
Chill, 'Ye, chill, chill, chill
Shit’s burned up already
It’s over

 

[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anaesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse "Did you do the research?"
She asked me, "Can you sign some t-shirts?"
Bitch, is you smokin reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still

[Hook]
I smile, when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just "One Thing"
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
Cause with my family we know where home is
And so instead of sending flowers, we're the roses

[Hook]
I smile, when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

(Sung) Oh, Rosie brings the sunshine, oh

[Hook]
I smile, when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

[Outro (with Patti LaBelle)]
I, smile, when Rosie come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
Oh Rosie brings the sunshine (say)

Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Oh oh oh oh no no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh-uh
I won't wait, no

 

[Intro]
Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know
Let me...

[Verse]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there

[Chorus]
In the streets
In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

[Verse]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there

[Chorus]
In the streets
In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets

[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
Kanye, it's Foxx, man
I'm just sayin' I was talkin' to the girls you know
And we don't put enough emphasis on the ladies sometime
You know, I was talkin' to this girl
She was talkin' about the music all fast in the club you know
She gotta drink water cause she thirsty
She danced like ninety-two hundred songs back to back
With ain't nobody really try to find out what she feelin'
Like how she feel... you know what she told me?
(Are you gonna be?) Check it out, this is what she said
(Say that you're gonna be) Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooooo

[Hook: Jamie Foxx & Luther]
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

[Interlude: Kanye West]

You know what I told her?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'mma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin' me, callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lyin' though?
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready For The World, she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross, you gon' take yo pants off

[Interlude: Aisha Tyler & Kayne West]
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby
Can you please? Do it faster, baby, do it faster!
Damn, baby; I can't do it that fast... but I know somebody who can. Twista!

[Verse 2: Twista]
Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan man and Twist
In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy, play some R&B
While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stoplight, move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b - dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jammin', havin' deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I love the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club wit me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin' me
And still will be in love wit me, Chi ride

[Hook: Jamie Foxx & Luther]

Chasing y'all dreams and what you've got planned
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned

[Chorus: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local, c'mon, homie, we major

[Post Chorus: Kanye West]
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9
Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me

[Chorus: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local, c'mon, homie, we major

[Post Chorus: Nas]
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major

[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, still"
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived, of executive 9 to 5's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never; it's orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

[Chorus: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local c'mon homie we major

[Hook: Kanye West + (Nas)]
We major? (C'mon homie we major)
We major? (C'mon homie we major)
We major (C'mon homie we major)
We major

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never; it's orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

[Spoken: Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?!
I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker
I'mma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear
Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building
GOOD Music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals! Sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
Uhh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warryn Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me: "Why you call it Late Registration, 'Ye?"
Cause we takin these muh'fuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along

[Bridge: Tony Williams + Kanye West]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feelin good)
But better late than never; it's orientation (It's orientation)
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away
We want you to get used to this
Uhh, they can't do what we do baby
Uh-uh, uh-uh, they can't do what we do baby
Uh-uh, uh-uh, they can't do what we do baby
Yeah

 

[Verse: Gil Scott-Heron]
Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-DOOM
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded, the bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin'
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
"All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night"
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?

[Claps and applause]

Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, "Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch"
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'mma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh, I guess I figure it's

[Hook: John Mayer]
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you, hate you at the very same time

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
Saying, "You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be"
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

[Hook: John Mayer & Kanye West]
Bittersweet (I fucked up and I know it, G)
You're gonna be the death of me (I guess it's bittersweet poetry)
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency

Never did this before, that's what the virgin says

[Skit: Kanye West & Woman]
She really thought that?
Yeah
Yeah, she’s so paranoid
Yeah, that’s good, paranoid
Girl's gonna love this song, ahaha
Why are you so paranoid?
Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Don't be so paranoid
Don't be so

[Refrain: Kanye West]
Baby, don't worry 'bout it

You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Tell me right now
You really wanna spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good, might do us good
'Fore we be done for good
'Cause I could make it good, I could make it hood
I could make you come, I could make you go
I could make you high, I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky, hey, maybe so
All of the time
You be up in mine checkin' through my cell phone, baby, no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
Here's another fight, oh, here we go (oh, here we go)

[Chorus: Kanye West, Mr. Hudson & Kid Cudi]
Baby, don't worry about it
Lady, we'll go out to the floor
Anyway, they don't know you (they don't know) like I do
They'll never know you (never know)
Anyway, they don't know you (never know) like I do
They'll never know you

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me
Show some gratitude, leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah, you see 'em look
Baby, let 'em look, give ya cold looks 'cause we look cold
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
'Til you finally let that thing go
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel
But sorry, we're closed

[Chorus: Kanye West, Mr. Hudson & Kid Cudi]
Baby, don't worry about it
Lady, we'll go out to the floor
Anyway, (hey) they don't know you (to the floor) like I do (hey)
They'll never know you (never know)
Anyway, they don't know you (they don't know) like I do
They'll never know you

[Refrain: Kanye West]
Baby, don't worry about it
Lady, don't even think about it
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson & Kid Cudi]
Anyway, they don't know you like I do

Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)

[Verse 1]
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca-Cola
Then I'm co-coming over cause it's ne-never over

[Hook]
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)

[Verse 2]
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca Cola
And I keep co-coming over cause it's ne-never over

[Hook: Strings]
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?

I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this uhh
Let's say all your friends, remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
Ok, ok, ok (You make me smile with my heart)
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me: I mean just, uhh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean let it be
I just let it be
I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart)
I mean you, her and me
Maybe, baby, baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it (You make me smile)

It's what ya all been waitin' fo', ain't it?
What people pay paper fo', damn it
They can't stand it, they want somethin' new
So let's get reacquainted, became the hood favorite
I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit' that fresh shit on
Wit' somethin' crazy on my arm, uh-huh-hum
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds

[Hook: Kanye West]
We outta here, baby! We outta here, baby!
We outta here, baby!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Dude! Fresh off the plane – Konnichiwa, bitches!
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it, I did it – that asshole done did it!
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it
I don't need writ–ears, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year?
They say "He goin' crazy and we seen this befo'"
But I'm doin' pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doin' pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga, please, how you gon' say I ain't no Lo-head?
'Cause my Dior got me more model head?
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard till your knees hit yo' forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top five MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
Top five MCs, you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big, you can't sit behind me

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit' that fresh shit on
Wit' somethin' crazy on my arm, uh-huh-hum

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, we outta here, baby!
What? What? We outta here, baby!
Ayy, Mr. West, we so outta here, baby!
And me? I'm Mr. Weezy Baby, yeah!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm so bright, not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fuckin' good like I'm sleepin' with Meagan (ha!)
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns, and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant "have them" – I'm so crazy!
But if you play crazy, you be sleepin' with daisies
I'm such a hayvoc – oops, I meant "havoc"!
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still col' like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties (baow!)
And I ate it 'cause I'm so avid (no homo)
And I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried – suck my bat, bitch (ha!)

[Hook: Kanye West & Lil Wayne]
We outta here, baby!
We outta here, baby!
We outta here, baby!
Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah!

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter

It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep
It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep
Her love is all that I can see
Her love is all that I can see

[Hook]
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter, winter, winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?

[Verse 3]
If spring can take the snow away
If spring can take the snow away
Can it melt away all of our mistakes
Can it melt away all of our mistakes

[Hook 2]
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, I won't ever love again
Never again

 

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this "give or take" world I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'mma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh
No lights but them infrared lights
Long life, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life

[Hook: Rihanna]
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ready, set, go, go, go, go, go
Go til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
"Westside bitch," quote, unquote
Woah there boy, don't go there ho
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named "Big" got bodied, huh?
But every rapper named "Sean" got money, ooh?
Well I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20 so I be counting a hundred 100's
Oh my Allah, Lordy lordy lordy, I took your chick
Now you want beef and I am chuckling like I'm Porky
Cause you spend all day with her spooning
I spend all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
They want these bullets to book it for me
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gonna book report me
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard, because bitch I'm an emergency

[Hook: Rihanna]
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Bridge: Big Sean]
So good, so good, Westside, so hood
I do it.. B. I.... G

[Verse 3: Drake]
Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding, Weezy with me
I just stepped out of the strip club, made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I don't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some "me time"
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
I'm really about to go Spring Break now
And start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one, so call it a night, call it a night
And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that, all in the Sprite, all in the Sprite

 

[Intro: Kanye West]
We in the streets, playa, get ya mail
It's only two places you end up, either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now throw ya hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Two words, United States, no love, no breaks
Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules
Presidential scandals, everybody move
Two words, Mos Def, K. West, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game 'pon lock shit, gun 'pon cock shit
We won't stop shit, everybody move
Two words, BK, NY, Bed Stuy

Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Two words, Chi-town, South Side, worldwide
'Cause I rep that 'til I fuckin' die
One neck two chains, one waist two gats
One wall twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight, Blueprint five mics
Go Getters rhyme like, should've been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated
Barbershop playa-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words, Chi-town raised me crazy
So I live by two words: "fuck you, pay me"
Screamin', "Jesus, save me"
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God, it's the same me
And I basically know now, we get racially profiled
'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom so the top's the only place to go now

[Chorus: Kanye West (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)]
Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
(Throw your hands up high)
Oh, everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Two words, free way, two letters, AR
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Joyner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car, my God
Two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
Free, young boss, freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs
To brawl, forget ya squad, better fend for yourself
Have you screamin' out four words, "send for the law", uh
Two words, Freeway slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad

[Outro: Mos Def (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)]
Red, white, blue, black (Throw your hands up)
Calm down, move back
Motherfuckers askin' "who is that?"
You know it's the almighty Black Jack
Mos Def, K. West
Ghetto people get this shit off ya chest
North to the south, to the east, to the west
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest
(High) And show it to 'em like

 

[Intro: Mos Def]

Driving around town looking for the best spot
For the drunk and hot girls

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
Love the dangerous necessity that people seek
Without regard to where they are
The human heart is curious
Above all things, love, the lights are low, your eyes are bright
The music plays, it's sweet delight
It's out of sight, I'm feeling right
Your dress is tight
Oh howwwwww, I want you right now

[Verse 4: Kanye West (w/ Mos Def)]
Don't tell me, you sing, you about to get a deal
You drunk and hot girl
"Ah da da da da," That's how the fuck you sound

[Intro]
Wise man say, wise man say
Wise man say
You'll never figure out real love
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love

[Verse 1]
It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I sacrifice, real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights
Do you think I sacrifice, a real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart, out of this hell
And my mind, out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back, a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life

[Hook]
I just wanna be a real boy
They always say "Kanye, he keeps it real boy"
Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy

[Verse 2]
It's funny
Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth, and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin for something out there, tryna find something
I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
What does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, "Where's my camera?"
For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cryin, say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh!?

[Hook]
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes

[Verse 3]
And there is no Gepetto, to guide me
No one, right beside me
The only one, was behind me
I can't find her no more, I can't call her no more
I can't..
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen
And when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left
And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death
Thinkin' the money that the-
You spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left, for a real boy!
They say "Kanye, you keep it too real boy"
Perspective, and wise man say
One day, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
Wise man say

[Verse 1]
'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King's?
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her there's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh

[Pre-Hook]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now
Drop it, drop it

[Hook]
'Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop?
Now I don't need no Robocop

[Verse 2]
Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her there's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh

[Pre-Hook]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now
Drop it, drop it

[Hook]
'Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop?
Somebody please make her stop

[Verse 3]
Stop ... drop ... roll ... pop
Bitch I'm cold ... I
Ain't used to being told ... stop
So I could never be your robot
Fast or slow, you can stay or can go
Now, now that you know, now, now that you know
Yeah I had her before but that happened before
You get mad when you know, so just don't ask me no more
Ok, ok, ok, uh, uh
It ain't ok, ok, ok

[Outro]
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)
Oh you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me
Oh you're kidding me
Haha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
You need to stop it now
Oh you need to stop it now

 

[Spoken: DeRay]
What in the fuck was that, Kanye?! I told you to do some shit for the kids! You can give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now! You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis! You will not walk across that stage, you won’t slide across that stage! A muthafucka can’t pull you across that stage, Kanye! Who told you? See, I told you to do somethin' uplifting! I’m tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you're gonna do me! You know what, you's a nigga. And I don’t mean that in no nice way. Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you. You throw your muthafuckin hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-mothafuckin-body! Cause you gettin' the fuck out of this campus! What the fuck you gon' do now, Kanye?

[John Legend]
I'm no longer confused, but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules, but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school, but don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me, but don't tell anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job, just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody

 

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon, more chips than Pentium
"What'cha gon' buy next?" Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks, and I'm so broke
I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean, twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with me y'all

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college
And dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale that's usin' a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a $free.99
Later on I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm den-a-muhh, she asked
"Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?"
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby, I fully understand, let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head, that'll really piss him off

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the four dot six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
"K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam"
So say my name like Candyman
And I'mma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man

[Chorus: Kanye West & The Game]
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music nigga

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
From the place where the father's gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the Madigan's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the President, look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

[Chorus: Kanye West & The Game]
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)

[Outro: Malik Yusef]
Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a lil' somethin' somethin' on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mommas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon' keep baggin' up this here crack music

[Intro]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha...)
Please stop your crying

[Chorus]
I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

[Verse 1]
Stop all your blood clot cryin', I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely enough time to sign in
Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear you, Mom
Yeah, yeah, I don't wan' be broke when I'm thirty-one
They said the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West
There's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even prerequisites?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh
Stop your cryin', baby

[Chorus]
I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

[Verse 2]
You know when you be late you miss all the lights
That's right (that's right), that's right (that's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (that night), that night
Baby, it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them Eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?
Hmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later?
"I'll be there in five minutes," go 'head, ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah

 

[Verse 1]
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When you decide to break the rules

[Refrain]
'Cause I just heard some real bad news

[Verse 2]
People'll talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you how long have you known dude
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When you decide, to break the rules

[Refrain]
'Cause I just heard some real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news

[Bridge]
Oh, you just gon' keep another no you won't
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
Oh, you just gon' keep another love for you
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
While I'm waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
My face turned to stone when I heard the news

[Outro]
What's on the news?
Channel cruise

 

[Intro]
I'm cold! (Yeah)
I'm cold! (Yeah)
I'm cold! (Yeah, yeah)

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how'd you'd get there
Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door, door, door, door, door
After tonight there will be no return
After tonight I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that you know

[Bridge: Kanye West]
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Okay, I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you cause I'm just gon' be fine
Okay, I got you out my mind
And the night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well, now you know

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Tell everybody, everybody that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how'd you'd get there
Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Baby girl I'm finished
I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented
I really thought we meant it
But now we just repent it
And now we just resent it
The clouds is in my vision
Look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you
Girl we through
You think your shit don't stank
But you are Mrs. Pee-Yew
And I don't see you
With me no more
Now tell everybody that you know
That you know

[Outro]
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know

 

[Intro]
I hear you, I hear you, L-Boogie
Remember they used to call you that?
What you say, Lauryn?
You just keep singing, I'mma tell 'em
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you all when it all falls down
(Oh when it all)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this!"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self-conscious I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

Don't stop that shit, keep that shit
Keep that part where I ran out of breath
We ain't doing no punch-ins, man
That's that fake shit
If I was on stage, how I gotta spit it?
It's from the heart anyway
Might cause shortness of breath, ya know?
Couldn't have got nobody better for the job
Thank you very much this a beautiful
Beautiful young lady that's inspired me definitely

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

[Verse: Kanye West]
We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say "Yo, no hablo inglés"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something

[Bridge: Brandy]
What you calling?
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya
What kind of dream we found?
See, I'm often catching crosswinds
Forgetting where the hell I met you
And try to bring me down

[Hook: Brandy]
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Uh yeah, is y'all ready for 20-07? It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer, wow, we buggin' out
Since '86 showing the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of "classic" is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubting the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosigning, even non-believers
Since I came in the door became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptowns, we call 'em uppies when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One teaches
Nas made you look before the heaters
I bet you Kan' had em on when he walked with Jesus

You can't buy this Superfly-ness, like a shine is
Your Highness is performing; look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two, like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, 'til you listen to my pace
‘Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident
And y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic, it's gon' last forever then
I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been

Hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Nas'll rock well

[Verse 3: Nas]
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper
To them, it hurts to hear this
Oh, you went platinum? Yeah, that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it, the car ain't important
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firin' in my environment
Leaving you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's, the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to, yeah

How many of y'all got Criminal Minded?
You, you, you; y'all don't be blinded
Me, I got no jewels on my neck
Why? I don't need 'em, I got your respect
KRS-One, twenty years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we's a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at? C'mon, where you at?
This is the difference between emceeing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun
These are the lyrics of KRS-One

[Intro]
While you're fast asleep

[Verse 1]
Do you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, faintness and dizziness? The idea that someone else can control your thoughts. Feeling others are to blame for most of your thoughts. Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. Feeling afraid in open spaces or in public. Thoughts of ending your life. Feeling that most people could not be trusted. Poor appetite, heart or chest pains?

[Chorus]
I feel like this
I feel like this
I feel like that
I feel like this all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time

[Verse 2]
Do you feel tempered outbursts, that you cannot control? Feeling lonely, even when you are with people, feeling blocked. Feeling blue, sad, feeling disinterested in things, feeling fearful. Are your feelings easily hurt? Feeling that people are unfriendly, or do you feel like people dislike you?

[Chorus]
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time

[Verse 3]
Do you have trouble falling asleep? Nausea, upset stomach, hot or cold spells? Numbness, tingling in parts of your body, trouble catchin' your breath?

[Chorus]
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin’ the good life
Yeah, though it’s forty below the wind chill
And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I’m so happy I’m with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh,” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in your drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said, “It’s Dee-ricious”
Hahahaha, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Kanye West]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls (Uh, uh)
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall (I'm like Bad Santa though)
Even though we ain’t ballin’ (Somebody sit on my lap)

The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 2: Vado]
Merry Xmas, Santa Claus cherry X6
They ain't hear my rain, dear, make it snow on the next chick (Yes)
Got enough toys, wonderin' what's my next pick
Before my exit, it get diamond Rolex reckless (Huh)
Big bags, got everything on the checklist
Necklace, baguette wrist (Uh-huh)
Pockets fat, they precious (Uh-huh)
Give Ma a peck kiss, look and tell her she precious (Mwah)
Lightin' up the sour, this tree give me the best gifts (Vado)

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
And I remember when I couldn't play Santa Claus (Uh)
No reindeers, just horses and a Panamera Porsche (Vroom-vroom)
We on two fifth shoppin', what the damage cost? (At most?)
I got your fam while you biddin' in the can up north (I got you)
Woops, I’m at Neimans, I hope they still got em (Word)
You want the thigh high spikes with the red bottoms (Size 37)
Err, let's make a toast 'cause Christ is born
We gon’ party all night 'til the lights come on (Amen)

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem

Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 4: Cyhi the Prynce]
Yeah, Mom and Dad, I won't be home for the holidays
Ha, I’m over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I’m sorry that I gotta stay
I’m with Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Lettin' the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I’m in New York, I’m still reppin' for the A
Cyhi!

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Pusha T]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all (Yes, it's G.O.O.D. Music, y'all)
The mistletoe’s right here (Check it, uh, uh)
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 5: Pusha T]
On the stoop of that Brownstone, shovellin' the brownstone
Santa’s on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Downtown got me feelin' like it’s Dow Jones
But uptown got me feelin' like its down home
Snow like sugar hill, chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?

[Verse 6: Big Sean]
Oh, pose for them photo stills
You don't wanna miss a moment, where’s your NoDoz pills?
I caught her lookin' at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel, hope you know those real
Okay, my white girl Veronica, black girl Monica
Got me celebrating ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah
Rock-rock-rock-rock-rock-rock-rockin' dashikis with a yarmulke
Where the Christmas tree at? Let's design it up

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 7: Cam'ron]
Uh, Lenox Ave to Saint Nick, never seen Saint Nick (Nah)
Just niggas sellin' the same nicks, the same bricks (What up, y'all?)
Same hustlers running' up to Broadway
That's where the snow’s at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey or greens, just Jimbo’s (Jimbo's)
Christmas lights in project windows (Yes)
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah (My lawyers)

[Verse 8: Teyana Taylor & Musiq Soulchild]
All the flashin' lights up on a tree
The house lit up nice
With your family is where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don’t that make you feel good?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let’s have Christmas in the hood

[Verse 9: Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashin' lights
Yeah, them things shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you’re Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won’t you come sit on my knee?
And tell me everything that you want
‘Cause, baby, I’m your Santa Claus, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

 

[Intro: Mos Def]
I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true

[Hook: Mos Def]
I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'mma just say good night

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday, like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man, I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
Man (man), I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'?
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life (real life), if you try to
So close (so close), but so far (so far)
And so far (so far), no cigar (no cigar)
We can't dwell on the past, all we got is today
So I'mma live like it's no tomorrow, no goodbyes

[Hook]
I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'mma just say good night

[Verse 2: Al Be Back]
Uh, to you
If I part, my art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like every day new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
My art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like every day new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical

[Hook]
I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'mma just say good night

[Outro: Mos Def]
I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true

 

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh, GOOD Music, this our year
Backing drums by DJ Premier
Now let me count it down, who the fuck up in here
Common, Don, Old G, battle rap, oh
That niggas know you can’t really fuck with that
Pusha T, the Clipse just made a classic
Good music together we too Jurassic, you stay plastic
Ramadan with the flow, guaranteed everyone fasting
Big Sean is a don
Cyhi Da Prynce
Why you so nervous dog stop being tense
If you ain't talking bout Rash we ain't got nothing in common
Fuck that and thats just common sense

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Came in the game, 8 years prior
8 years later, your mans on fire
My Book of Eli, to all my subscribers
Play the two doors, street car named desire
Came in Grindin’, Ye’ came Through the Wire
Met at the crossroads, Bone thugs inspired
1st of the month, Trump to the buyers
Red Toupée on the coupe you've been fired
Smooth criminal, no prior’s
Man in the mirror, check no liar
Still let that "butter fly" like Mariah
Show me the money the black Jerry MaGuire
Tom Cruise on that couch if that money right
West Hollywood feels like a bunny night
With GOOD company and better jewelers
To the Good Life, we GOOD music

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day’s a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I’m pressed clean
Detroit’s Angel, I even got red wings
I’m headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life’s prom night and guess who’s the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I’m Don King
Everybody know I’m coming soon like LeBron’s ring
I’m Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter
Sean Combs and Connery all in one
Whoever told you sky’s the limit is looking dumb
Cause I’m 22 and I’m moonwalking on the sun
Oh thats your girl?
She feelin on my "whoa there!", right next to a couple boaters
And she tryna motor boat her
And im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor
You might find banana clips ’cause it’s Guerilla warfare
Last year I was watching this from the couch
And now I’m here
That should let you know what I’m about
Reaper black suit cuz my whole team’s killing
Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin
Many tell me I’m the man I ain't made it yet
Tell me who the baddest, I’ll see if I seen them naked yet
Won’t stop til I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet

[Verse 3: Cyhi Da Prince]
I’m Mr Got bread like Quizno’s
Better known as MJ with the big nose
I swear your artist couldn’t see me on his tip toes
Only on TV I gotta take a quick pose
Let me stop I forgot this was a big show
And being dope made you broke I am piss poor
I’m big poppa plus I’m 2pacalypto
My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for
Huh, I’m doing this for hip hop
Im coming after you, him and his spot
Still tied to the streets like a hitch knot
Ain't nothing fake, I’m not a Rolly with a tick tock
Atlanta repper in the home of the Yankee
Rose wood suit on with the hanky
I got rich from the zones of the stanky
So everybody know my money long, lanky!
So I’m flexible stretching out my decimel’s
Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles
Can’t bleep it out cuz there wasn’t nothing sexual
I’m blowing loud, somebody check the decibels
I’m impeccable they put me on the pedestal
And if you bite me, it’s good for you like a vegatable
Shows by the several, schedule full of festivals
And if I ever do time than you know its federal
Uh, incredible, yeah

[Verse 4: Common]
F-f-fam fam fam I’ma monster too
You don’t see I do things that the monsters do
The incomparable, remarkable, articles
About my audio technique, my technique
I recognise games like the ESPY’s
Cold to myself I say God Bless me the truth
So I speak live and directly
You, I will set free my mic is where my check be
Rah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro
Prolly in the metro just so I can get dough
The name is Common but the frame is special
Leave requested from the years I’ve invested
Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope
The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley
Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
The plan was to drink till the pain over
What’s worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake shit, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain't finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul
Rosewood we could see her with our eyes closed

And I'm feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They don’t want black people to think and drive

[Verse 2: Common]
He think he live, he think he cold
He think I’m high, I’m in thinker mode
Eyes lowed, I let the sky hold the thoughts
The streets are like the high road that I go across

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it’s Fashion Week
And the weather wasn’t barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music and forever we hot?
Motherfucker, are you ready or not?

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Bridge: Kanye West]
This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop
(Can’t stop, you can’t stop)
This goes out to the all core hip-hop
(Can’t stop, you can’t stop)

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
As Ye flips the piano
The mood swings like the change of a channel
He’s heating up like they wrapped him in flannel
Selling kilos through your iPod Nano
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal
Money drive you crazy, look at Marbury’s handle
Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires
Ice cream paint job, something like Breyer's
Euro tank top, Dior-inspired
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required
Yuugh, in 2012 in 2010
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz
Floss for the members of the gang with the 20 in
While haters wish death upon me, that’s many men
Yeah, and if he slam you on your paper route
Stop talking, motherfucker, pull your paper out

[Hook: Kid Cudi & Charlie Wilson]
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Verse 5  Big Sean]
Now tell me, do it feel good? Well, all right
Don’t worry, we gon' be here all night
And you know a nigga rep that Westside (Westside)
Westside, Westside
So t-t-tell me who the freshest of them all?
They claiming that they fresh, they ain’t fresher than my balls
A nigga suited fresh like I'm headed to the ball
MC hunting season, putting heads up on the wall
I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft
Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers
I guess that's why in school, my grades went from A's to B's to C's
All over double D's, I be absent all week
This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for
Man, that’s the fam, we let ‘em in through the side door
Hold on, that’s the girl you gave a wedding ring?
Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything

[Interlude: Charlie Wilson & Kanye West]
And let me hear you say ahh, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
And let me hear you say ahh, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
(As promised!)

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
Now put your hands up to the sky
Until the day in that we die
And we'll be here all evening
G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

 

[Verse 1]
You don't need me to ever write
I read your last message at least 1000 times
At least 1000, at least 1000 times
Alright, alright, alright
Why did you ever listen to
People trying to hate on you
At least you know that's nothing new
Stop everything you're doing now
'Cause baby, you're awesome
So awesome
You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
I hope you ready for tonight

You can't be still
You gotta move, you gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I got a hope, I got a chance
Cause baby, you're awesome
You don't need to listen to your manager
You're way too hot for them to handle you
Baby, not for nothing
I know you're looking for something
And I've got it
Why you fallin' on me
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right
Oh, you nnannanaa
I know you must be tired
From running through my mind
Can I come inside?
Cause baby you're awesome
Also, I'm also awesome, also
I'm also awesome
Y'all know
And I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park, you're so after time
You're so breaking ?, oh it feels so right

 

[Hook]
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass

[Verse 1]
Why you actin' all
Shy and all

"I never did this before..."
Stop that
What, you want some Patron?
I got that
I mean I promise y'all
You fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is gon' give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off

[Bridge]
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris' and some Mo'
And we about to let it floooooow
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that 'dro
And we about to let it bloooooow

[Hook]
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass

[Verse 2]
See you know my style
I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said, "daddy that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was practicing
'Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though? You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child 'cause now y'all

[Hook]
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass

[Bridge]
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris' and some Mo'
And we about to let it floooooow
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that 'dro
And we about to let it bloooooow

God level
Provide a new coffin
You don't see murder like this this often
God level
God level
Our father
Might as well make a new casket
God level
God level
God level

You see sharks in the water
Then they try to do nothin' but put cocks in your daughter
Don't say nothin' 'bout what Ye said
Don't move, mothafucka, play dead
Yeah, we cool, mothafucka, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse: Common]
Yeah
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, "Behold the Pale - Horse"
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it -

[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]
"Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again"

 

One glad morning
When this life is over
I'll fly away
To a land where
Joy shall never end
I'll fly away

Oh I'll fly away oh glory
I'll fly away
When I die Hallelujah bye and bye
I'll fly away

[Intro: Mos Def & Swizz Beatz]
Yeah, yeah, there it go, there it us
This, is something special (uh-huh, yeah)
This, is something new (it's an amazing time)
This, is something special (look around)
This, is something new (the power of observation)

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours, guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shades
He knew those lights only grew bright to fade
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell the hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, what must they give away?
Who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay?
Surprise, it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please, pardon these and such curious minds
Peace, safe passage, precious time hither and gone
The day of days, Yawm al-Qiyāmah
This tiny stone illuminated by a star
The only star so large, many more
To make our largest star show small, furthermore
The end is not the end no stop but a pause
And what we can witness isn't all there is at all
Custom mock of a scotch and pork chops
The passion, expansion, the order of the random
See the dreamers, see the sleepers
Why'd you wake them? Sweet Jesus
Enlighten the Earth, seek heaven first
Let's put in this work

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Her heels set the mood, where did you acquire those Alaïas?
When I met you I heard Jesus, bells, strings and the choir
I got lines that's better than niggas' albums, plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that's nuts
I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks, we ain't dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
I'm trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I ain't stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie?
And if I'm a douche, then put me in your coochie
I swear they shoulda never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies
Booby trap, holla back

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord (you know, AK on the lamp like what's that?)
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (huh? Click clack)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
All white Bentley, I call that mama
My life crazy, like Obama's
You talk slick? Well I'm Osama
Bin Laden, I'm what's happening, I get it cracking
All black Carbon, on my wrist, yeah
It's gonna take you a couple years to get this here
Thank AP, well they thank me
And I be mad too, if you ain't me
Call me Mr. Dean, or Mr. Boss
See me riding clean, in a Rolls Royce
Niggas talking funny, that's old money
Niggas looking crazy, but they talking funny
Nowadays rappers, they like bloggers
You see me? I'm a bank hogger
Coming through your hood, in a Brinks truck
With 25s on it like what the fuck?
100 feet and better, what the fuck you stick?
Paparazzi on the water with the fuck-you stick
My face got the "fuck you pricks"
My beats go hard like fuck you dicks
Pouring champagne damn thing
See me rocking suede, nigga, in the damn rain
Ain't a damn thing, money ain't a damn thing
Ask Yeezy and Mos, we do the goddamn thing

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Get down with the precious leathers
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Aiyyo, open glass on my fingers, I sit back like I'm caged
But still caking, my niggas is hating
It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
You a piece of steak, I'd rather be that than some bacon
Every project is a throne only just bigger stones they throw
That's why I wear a big hat and roll weed
Gone if you don't know where you came or when you came
All you know is weed and cocaine, nonbelievers no game
I'm zooted down, rolling a spliff, maxing
Flaming like wheels got traction, I'm sun, he's attractive
Guaranteed to service the real niggas out cruising in a Volvo
A duffle for dolo, buffy polo
A blow house is where I resided once
Live amongst fiends, counting currency, hitting blunts
Only to hear the door rumble, grab the 4
Hope it ain't the law or maybe some nigga trying to score

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (Lord)
L-Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

That's kind of how this rap was pieced, hahahah
Most definitely this rap was pieced

 

[Skit 1: DeRay Davis]
Now beat that!
And your mother's saying "Go to college"
So you finish college and it's wonderful
You feel so good
And after all the partying and craziness
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around your peers
Hey!
Now you'll get that 25-thousand dollar job a year
And you'll spend all your money on crack cocaine
But, it'll be YOUR money
No more borrowing from mom for my high!
So now you get your degree tattooed on your back
Cause you're so excited about it
If you continue to work at the Gap, after several interviews, oh my God
You'll come in at a entry-level position
And when you do that
If you kiss enough ass
You'll move up to the next level
Which is being the secretary's secretary
And boy is that great
You can take messages for the secretary
Who NEVER went to college
She's actually the boss's niece!
So now you're part of the family
You know what college does for you?
It makes you really smart, man
All you kids wanted to talk in the back of the class
Not me, I listened
Okay?
I was a hall monitor
This was meant to be
You know how many classes I took?
Extra classes, extra classes
No, I've never had sex
But you know what?
My degree keeps me satisfied
When a lady walks up to me and says
"Hey, you know what's sexy?"
No, I don't know what it is
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse
Very fast

 

[Hook]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Verse 1]
I sold my soul to the devil: that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring?
It's feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dogg, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

[Hook]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Verse 2]
I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys
Like a Happy Meal
I’m spaced out dog
I be on that moontalk
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle
Let's exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious, gettin' anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say I’ve been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
I’ll be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T
I’m not right dog, I’m slightly off
I’m paranoid; like bonin’ raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea, that’ll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you, I should’ve had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off

[Hook]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh, we got the black elite in the house tonight
Rosewood
I feel like I'm at the NAACP or something right now
The Essence Festival
Q-Tip on the beat too, uh, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe 'cause it's flooded
Why you walk around with a baby cross's cousin?
My teeth already white, y'all gon' make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds, what's the cause of the frontin'?
Why y'all got all caps on?
Don Cheadle time, get extra black on 'em
Burn, Hollywood, burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the pyramids
I swear life's a bitch on her period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links
You can look at me, tell I ain't fuck what nobody think
And my face always lookin' like somebody stinks

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Question:
What color was the skin of the man who beared the cross?
No matter how many lashes, they couldn't beat it off
How many Cassius' will we see in one lifetime?
That's why it's Miles Davis, Kobe, it's Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in
The 1800s, y'all forget that
I got called "nigga" on Twitter so many times, yo, I lived that
Now I'm just tryna find where to raise my kids at
'Cause they don't want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey, realtor, I'm lookin' for a nice park
Twelve noon, she said my family gon' make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listenin' to, in this existence
Don't give up now, just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep him away, huh? Something might happen
This is the makin' of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master, "Peace!"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Some wear a suit and tie, they don't wanna remain average
Some wear a suit and tie like a chain and a straitjacket
My chain heavy, stop in that traffic, coppers harass us
Then DA attack us, want us in chains like B.A. Baracus
So no major factor in my decision to be a rapper
Was rebellion; being anti-establishment was attractive
To a black kid from Brooklyn, flames got the thangs cooking
Land of the juks where them lames get them chains tooken
It ain't lookin' good for you if you're a tourist here
Sometimes I rhymes the sort of frequency that only purists hear
A couple rappers tried to beef with me, nobody's scared
Niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
Why I gotta battle rappers? I debate scholars
Question: do it gotta make sense if it make dollars?
Sick visions is living inside of brains
It's like we sadomasochistic, addicted to whips and chains
Figuratively, quite literally, clinically insane
Spit flames and then visit the higher plane
Try in vain to ignore it, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it
'Ye, them lonely-idled whores by the boards, trust

[Verse 4: Consequence]
That old ball-and-chain had me chained up for weeks
So of course I'm off the chain as soon as I hit the streets
And now when we link she saying the game's over
I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
Now the new dude she's saying that can stay over
Should be a chain, who goes by the name of Choker
That's what he did when she told him he should play the sofa
So the chains on the door, I'm on the way over
Now when I came over, his only response
Was, "You must be the owner of a chain of restaurants
'Cause I'mma eat your food for that chain that I wore
'Cause you be running 'round like the chain make the man"
So it's obvious the he don't know the chain of command
'Cause my chain commands, that kind of respect
And it's so chunky that it's a pain in the neck
But it came with a check, I remember on chaining day
It spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
"Them chain snatchers are hoping that you ain't ready
So don't get distracted, keep your aim steady
Or there'll be a chain reaction since my chain's heavy"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

 

[Hook: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Head's in the sky, wings raised and
She's about to fly, and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him, "Trust me"
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing this, he told her, "You won't leave me if you love me"
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So let's hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, "The end, question mark"

[Hook: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Don't let me hold you back, I only hold you back
We're on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby so high
Sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley, straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom, I woulda been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know that's very gross, but we getting very close
To our end, though I kill most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

[Hook: Mos Def & Kanye West]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Hook: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
How could you do it? How could you do it?

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay now baby here we go, we go, no baby, me go
You got my heart, baby this what it beat for
I give it all, walk as far as my feet go
What you mean "me go?" Why can't it be "we go"?
What happens when people turn to tears? (huh?)
Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years, huh?
Been standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple receipts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl, I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat
(Do it!) How could my girl do this to me?
Woke up to a note saying "The world did this to me"
Now I'm testing, one-two, reporting live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once, look like they lying in a huddle
But it's not even half the feeling
As hearing your "Seans, you know I love you"
Shedding tears everyday (I know you do)
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask "Why?" sometimes like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees everyday like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Of the Phoenix Sun and Nash it out
I mean ash it out so I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now

[Hook: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

 

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Doin' my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what, though?
I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

[interlude: Kanye West]
Hehe
I'ma take this one for the team
G.O.O.D. Music! Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You know what? I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies, gave it a nice try
You know what? I hate pictures of other people kids
I hate plastic couches in other people cribs
I hate when other people cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said, "I just cleaned up, baby, I can't tell"
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that God damn cucumber Bath and Body Works?
I can still smell the sweat, the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water? That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the La-Di-Da-Di verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I scored, he took the charge
Oooh, that shit gotta hurt

[Chorus: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Doin' my thing (Hah), pocket full of green (Yeah)
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans (Yeah)
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing (Ehh)
You know what, though?
I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Never mind me, 'Ye, have fun
If the cops ask, that's my gun
That's my weed, anything you need
I'ma take, I'ma take, I'm a take this one for the team
One fat ass, one flat ass
Nigga hit the switcheroo on my black ass
Ever seen Joe's Jeans on a jackass?
And my bitch got on tights with a tack ass
I'm a fly nigga, and I carry on
With them bottles of that Rosé and Perignon
Ever seen how a kingpin carries on?
Dookie rope link chain and a herringbone
The real shit, gotta feel this
First class flights, baby, that's a field trip
Double date, don't cooperate, kill switch
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch

[Chorus: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Doin' my thing, pocket full of green (Yeah)
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans (Yeah)
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing (Yeah)
You know what, though?
I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's G.O.O.D. Music in the house
And we got Keri

[Bridge: Keri Hilson & Kanye West]
Boy, I know you the one that I heard about (Hah)
And I know you workin' with it through word of mouth
Looks like I'ma have to test you in and out
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta
Take it for the team (Hah)
Take it for the team
Take it for the team (I like your mentality, baby)
Take it for the team (Hahahahaha)

[Verse 3: Cyhi the Prynce]
(CyHi!) I'm blowin' on stinky that come in a jar
(CyHi!) Playin' with her kitty, made her come in the car
(CyHi!) She a redbone but her cousin is dark
(CyHi!) A little out of shape but she'll fuck in the dark
Until she start complainin' 'bout her feet hurt
I'm trying to fuck, she talkin' 'bout she want to eat first
I'm like, "Why did this bitch have to bring her?"
Tryin' to get her back to the nest so I could sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
I said, "I got a chick for you that look like a singer
On a scale of one to ten, she's a fifteen-er"
Man, you shoulda seen a nigga face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
On my team, she would be a fifth stringer
I said, "I got the fine one in the Beamer
I'm the point guard and I need a wing, take it for the team"

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team

[Chorus: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Doin' my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what, though?
I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team
I'ma take this one for the team
G.O.O.D. Fridays
I'ma take this one for the team

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
It's the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check, check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now, she get her back blew out
She can't clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet I'm gon' sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her friend bust in, goddamn, who brought the raccoon out?
For the team, uh

[Break: Kanye West]
Like we always do at this time
Like, like we always do at this time
I go for, I got to
Like we always do at this time
Like we always do at this time
Go for, I got to
Like we always do at this time
Hah, like we always do at this time
Southside, we gon' set this party off right
This time
This time
Yeah, yeah
Mike Dean on the keys
Hey, oh

[Outro: Kanye West]
They love to hate
Bad model bitches, they love to date
They need to check my swag and get up to date
Check-check-check my swag and get up to date
Aye, it's the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches, they love to date
They need to check my swag and get up to date
Check-check-check my swag and get, uh, aye

 

[Intro: DeRay Davis]
Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wonderin'
Could you do a lil' som...
Somethin' beautiful, somethin' that the kids are gon' love when they hear it
Tha's gon' make them start jumpin' up and down, and sharin' candy and stuff
Think you could probably do somethin', for the kids, for graduation to sing?

 

You keep it going man
You keep those books rolling
You pick up all those books that you're gonna read and not remember
And you roll, man
You get that associate's degree, okay?
Then you get your bachelor's
Then you get your masters
Then you get your masters' masters
Then you get your doctorate
You go man!
And then when everyone says quit
You show them those degrees, man
When everyone says "Hey, you're not working, you're not making any money"
You say "You look at my degrees, and you look at my life
Yeah, I'm 52! So what?
Hate all you want, but I'm smart, I'm so smart
And I'm in school
All these guys out here making money all these ways
And I'm spending mine to be smart!
You know why?
Cause when I die buddy
You know what's gonna keep me warm?
That's right, those degrees."

 

I am Kanye West, and that feels really great, especially to say this year. I came here to present my new video, but before that, I'ma talk. Now... Later tonight, "Famous" might lose to Beyoncé, but I can't be mad—I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so, you know! But for people to understand just how blessed we are. It was an expression of our now. Our fame right now. Us on the inside of the TV. You know, just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump... I mean, like, I put Ray J in there, bruh! This is fame, bro! Like... I see you, Amber! My wife is a G, not a lot of people's wives would let 'em say that! We came over in the same boat, now we all in the same bed. Well... maybe different boats, but you know. If you think about it, last week, it was 22 people murdered in Chicago. You know, like, people come to me like, "Man, that's right! Tell Taylor to..." Bro, like, I love all y'all! That's why I called her! So, I was speaking at the Art Institute last year and one kid came up to me and said, "Three of my friends died and I don't know if I'm gonna be the next." And it has to... you know, you have to think like, you know when you're a senior and it's like the last month and you just don't feel like doing anymore work? If you feel like you're seeing people dying right next to you, you might feel like what's the point? You know, like, life could be, like, start to feel worthless in a way. I know times for me, I sit down and talk to older, rich people, you know -- aka white -- and uh, they tell me, "Don't compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don't compare yourself to Walt Disney." And my friend Sekaya told me -- ayy, bruh, bruh!

They tell me, "Don't compare yourself to these people," right? My friend Sekaya told me it's three keys to keeping people impoverished: taking away their esteem, taking away their resources, and taking away their role models. My role models are Artists Merchants. It's less than 10 I can name in history. Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West

(Audience cheer) Bro! Broooo!

Tonight, we're here to have fun. I'm standing in front of my idol, Puff Daddy. I'm standing in front of my wife, Kim Kardashian West. I'm standing in front of the future, Chance The Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith. Bro! We are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders. I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my art and I hope y'all have a good time

 

[Verse 1]
I, you don't need, need to ever write
I read your last message at least a thousand times
At least a thousand, least a thousand times
Alright, alright, alright
Why would you ever listen to people tryna hate on you
At least you know there's nothing new

[Chorus 1]
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby, you're awesome
So awesome
You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
I hope you're ready for tonight
I'm gon' cook, you'll be dessert
You can't be still
I gotta move, I gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I gotta hope, I got a chance
Cause baby, you're awesome

[Verse 2]
You don't need to listen to your manager
You're way too hot for them to handle you
Baby, not for nothing, I know you're lookin' for somethin'
And I got it, why you frontin' on me?

[Refrain]
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new

[Chorus]
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right

[Bridge]
You're so freakin' tight
I know you must be tired
Of running through my mind
Can I come inside?
Cause baby I'm awesome, also
I'm also awesome, also
I'm also awesome, y'all know

[Refrain]
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new

[Chorus]
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right

 

We broke, broke broke phi broke

[Intro: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La La La La
8732 that's the way it go
Kanye and Jizzle, say it ain't so
Wait till I get my money right

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
If I had a billion dollars (YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
Yeah, I'd spend all in a day, show these niggas how to play (play)
Top floor penthouse, I'll show them where I stay (stay)
Grand piano, might learn to play (Ha Ha!)
Need a hundred grand just to walk past it every day (Woo! Woo!)
You know I like them white keys on it (yea!)
Duct tape when we wrap them, call me prejudice
Cause I never touch the black ones (keys that is, Ha Ha!)
Let me show how to do this, shawty! (shawty!)
I hit the strip club and I blew bout forty (DAMN!)
Patron got me so confused (fused)
Until I stumbled outside and I made the news
Fresh nine piece, yeah them wings is cajun
Never seen me in the kitchen nigga, I am amazing (nah)
Well, fuck it I'm rich then
If balling is a crime, fuck it I'm hit then
If thugging is a term, fuck it I'm it then
The insane dough, hey, fuck it I'm sick then
Somebody call me a shrink
Until then, I'mma fix me a drink (Ha Ha!)
Top down in the Bent, I'm so intoxicated
Sometimes I think to myself "Goddamn, I made it"
And I know they hate it
On the all night flight
Trying to get my money right, wassup?

[Hook: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
La La La La (Hey!)
Wait till I get my money right
La La La La (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (HA HA!)
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
Yeah, homie this a theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Leer Jet
Fly as the insect, even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number cause
When I get my money right she gon come running
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "o"
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional
And my chain so fresh, they go (oh oh oh oh oh)
Right after the fame did you gain anything?
Damn 'Ye, would you change anything?
But (If I had a billion dollars! YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
I'd copped more pink polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
“Wait 'til I get my money” everybody's motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything I wrote
Yeah, hey, mama they can't hate him
'Cause after all of the drama, K slayed them

[Hook]

[Outro: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
(If I had a billion dollars YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
Wait till I get my money right
(If I had a billion dollars YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

[Connie Mitchell (Young Jeezy)]
(I'm serious, nigga! Hey!)
Why were you late?
(Yeah! HA HA!
Yeah! You know I'm serious, nigga! I got money!)

Oh oh oh oh oh
Good money made!
Oh oh oh oh oh
Good money made!
Why were you late?
Oh oh oh oh oh
Good money made!

 

[Intro]
Bom bom bom bom bom

[Hook]
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep

My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

[Verse 1]
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me no curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz somebody cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A living legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you Mama

I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
Mama, you know I love you so, and I'll never let you go
And I wrote this song just so you know that when you go

[Hook]
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep

My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

[Outro]
And this life is all a dream
And my real life starts when I go to sleep
My mama, mama, mama

 

[Hook]
I never liked you niggas
Who knew one day I'd be just like you niggas
Uh, alright you niggas, uh, alright you niggas
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

[Verse 1]
He walked in our lives I was only five
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly
Sittin there like why? He at least Hooper-Size
You know I scrutinize, like, "Who this newer guy?"
I'm my mama boyfriend, I'm her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasn't
Tryna get to know me, homie? Just kill the charm
You ain't interested in me, you just tryning to fuck my mom
We all the voices of our parents' bad choices
The aftermath of divorces, the kids of bitter split-ups
And babysitters, grandparents that don't know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new nigga
You old Old Spice wearing, short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing, church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance?
When you get here anyway? I already got parents
Don't try to put me in line, I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it, I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her that'd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I screamed out, "I ain't going to sleep no time soon!
And when I do, I'm sleeping in my mama's room!"

[Hook 2]
I don't like you nigga
If I was old enough I'd fight you nigga
I want to run over you with my bike, you nigga
Don't go to sleep at night, you nigga
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

[Verse 2]
Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see I'm dating, having problems of my own
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around
I never thought I'd ever raise another nigga's child
He don't like his mama's boyfriend just like me
Don't wanna do the wrong thing, that's very un-Spike Lee
But he be like D Bo round his mama, there
Cause when she here, he be quiet when she leave, he be talking again
He be wilding out, be calm
I don't drink the drama or sip the Dom-Tyler-Perry-on
"You gonna marry my mom?" Look, I don't read palms
And I don't read Psalms but I did take little man to church
Took little man to school
Look, little man, kids don't make the rules
Even though I ain't raised you, you your mama's angel
Don't get it twisted, baby boy, I'll Ving Rhames you

[Hook]
I never liked you niggas
Who knew one day I'd be just like you niggas
Uh, alright you niggas, uh, alright you niggas
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

 

[Hook: Nina Simone]
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
Good God! Midwest coast back, nigga
And don't say 'nigga' unless of course you black, nigga
Free country, they say that shit in Tennessee
'Cause I got all their white daughters drinkin' Hennessy
I'mma go to Sal's with some niggas on the wall
I might go to Oz, take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano's so involved
I know, King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had two Polos
We the kids they'll keep in the back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent, go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They ask about the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff
You know

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
Children of Jah
Children of Jah
Children of Jah, put your hands up

 

I brought you brothers here today to start our own fraternity
Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it
Broke Phi Broke (we ain't got it)
No, we have no money
We are sharin' jeans
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on
How many cars do we own? (None!)
How many cars do we own? (None, sir!)
Should we let our woman go and be with the cat in the car?
Yes, we will
Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me!
(We can't afford no gas!)
Say it!
(We can't afford no gas!)
So we ain't drivin'!

Hey Jimmy, where you going?
I don't know where I'm goin'
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees
My mom would always say "Dad, why don't you work?"
But he just kept learning
All the other kids' parents were working and saving up money for school
And I was actually in school all while my dad was in school!
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree
And now I'm just glad he left me these
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have
These are documented
My father left them for me
And I'm going to leave them to my kids
I'm going to learn too
I'm going to get super smart, so I, too, can die without money
But I'll be the smartest dead guy!
Who has that?

 

[Instrumental]

 

[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasn’t bi, no I seen it in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by
She had a lil' weed and would get a lil' high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo, back in 92', I was just like you
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel

[Hook]
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong? Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt, yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work, yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
"You never listen to me," then the call drop... hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Tryin' to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty g's to fifteen hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call, one ring, two rings, seven rings
Eight rings, er mother picked up the phone
Like, "She in school and she don't stay here no more"
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise

[Hook]
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

 

[Intro: Father's Children]
Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Perfect!)

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Yo!)

[Verse 1]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (Yo!)
10 thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (Yo!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (Yo!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Sonic boom!)

[Verse 2]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
I give 'em grey poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for? Haaan?
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (Yo!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (Yo!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2, Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2

[Outro: Father's Children]
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Perfect!)

[Hook: Kanye West]
Lost and, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lost and, found now
Turned out, our new love
Daddy, found out
How you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
I do, love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama, knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost and found now

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessey?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
I found you, oh Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Bridge: Kanye West]
And I need you now
Lost in my doubt

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
When she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"
"What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"

 

[Intro]
And it'll be a long time, before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 1]
They want me, hold my head in shame
So I hold 'em on, holding hands in vein
Couple [?] of the feds say I'm insane
A psych said I'm going [?]
And then his son told me put down the drink dawg
I got a [?]
I guess [?] finna chop it's head off
I need a little something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, life sucks

And every, god needs a goddess
And every, star couldn't guide us
It falls upon something that's inside us
So I [?] with my riders
[?] with my Riders
[?]

[Hook]
And I don't like them, and they don't like that
They don't like that, and I don't want that
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry about me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, don't worry what I do
Hating motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 2]
See I need some time to meditate
Naw bitch I'm fly I need time to levitate
And I don't sound try, tryna' hesitate
[?] nigga, you a featherweight
And I'm a heavyweight and I'm very great
I put the everyday rocking in every state
Do not debate, you cannot cape
I must've on faith, getting knocked of faith
Guess it's not faith, guess it was written
I can sell a phone, guess I was different
That was cellphone back then, that was different
Now I'm spitting and everybody's just spitting
And what it sound like when everybody sound like
What you sound like, bumpin' 'em on a round mic
I don't even have a knife
Feel like [?]
And these niggas are secondary like Pippen around Mike
Trippin' around sight, something on that down light
I'mma be downright, you niggas is downright biters
And I'mma [?] fighters
And my shit downright fire, from the corner buyer
And I'm alone, eh

[Hook]
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
Don't worry 'bout you, and what you gonna do
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout you and maybe I do
[?]
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you
I worry 'bout something not we can do
[?] me
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, na na na na
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Again, again
Before you ever see me again, me again, again, again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

[Bridge]
Can you clap your hands, hands
Clap your, clap your hand, hands
Clap your, clap your hand, hands
And I wanna something, I wanna something then
Can you clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand

[Verse 3]
So the song like a Section 8
So I pass that dick around like the collection plate
I can sell 'em on Sunday with the [?]
I be stunting with the stunnas, and that's the best you make
So if everybody just stand now, and shit don't pan out
Throw your hands up, at least give them a handout
And with the sun shown, it's like the Jerome is
[?] on the cellphone days, I'm homeless
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie
Wait, just need two shows just to get to me
Or feeling like Eddie Kane, I still got it
And it's something but the problem is, you still not it
Or maybe if it's sicker, they say I'm "that nigga"
Or maybe if [?] is not a cellphone [?]
Or maybe damn, I could just blow my shit [?]
Maybe I should stop being real, maybe I should get on Twitter
Maybe I should [?] I could reconsider
[?] cellphone liver
And I'mma drink until I can't stand and got no liver
I can stand and deliver 'til the [?]
And I'mma spit it, like it get it, gonna die by the [?]
I'd rather live by what I live by, then die when I'm fine
I'm gonna stand by my self 'til my very last breath
Cause you know what? A coward dies a thousand deaths
And I'm proud [?]
And I could style on [?], hell with this
You can't style on me, nigga I'm [?]
I'm liable to be a liability [?]
You plan to style on me, trying to style on me
Nigga, I'm liable to be a liability, and my ability
I can sound like [?]
[?]

[Hook 2]
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, something will do
And motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again
So don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I'll be up some, going for mine
And it'll be a long time
'fore you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you, worry 'bout you
'fore you ever see

[Verse 4]
Don't worry about what I been up to
When the fuck I'm going hard, nigga fuck you
Who the fuck is going, I can [?]
Who the fucks asking? I'll put the summer on blast and
Who the fucks lasting?
And be the last standing
Caught up on the [?]
Get a better tan and
I been feeling dandy
And who can run the planet? Pass them a Xanax
And n afternoon I annex
And all of the damage [?]
Left on the [?]
Who [?] after all, I guess it's a small world after all
Stunting on the sun, cus I have to ball
I run the world cause it's a small world after all
And I'm never after y'all
I have to loss somethin' and I got it all
And you feeling like you got it all?
[?]
Nah nigga, not at all

[Hook]
Worry 'bout me, don't worry bout me, just worry bout you
And what'chya gon' do?
It'll be a long time, before you ever see me again

[Verse 5]
[?] on the all out, [?] all out [?]
Last summer, last fight, and y'all had a fall out
I can sense [?] what y'all 'bout?
Bumping [?]something, and everything that y'all 'bout
Y'all had your ups and downs, you don't fuck around
Put everything on the [?] something then you go and fuck around
Bet you felt something, now you feel nothing now
Y'all feelings felt something, ya'll don't feel nothing now
Her tears dried up, [?] a specialist
I was under [?] and learning what the lesson is
What the ebony of essences, the Genesis
I got the fetishes, something on the [?]
[?] and you had to look at innocence
I wish we just could take it back to the Book of Genesis
Before the hook is in is there any point of any of this?
[?]
[?] put hands on you, then put his front side and put hands on you
Just turn around say for really? I'm done motherfucker
I [?]

[Hook]
Worry bout me, just worry bout you, I can [?] when I be good
And she said that
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, just worry 'bout you
And I'll be up now, what I've been up to
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Me again, me again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

 

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeezy, Ne-Yo, the remix ayo
I think it's time to hit 'em with the Mase flow
My uh, she was gettin the best of me
But oooh, child, you my destiny
And I know it's especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh, and you gon' question me
If she even stand next to me
But you should laugh, 'cause you my better half
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me (c'mon!)
Right now it feels so crazy
I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so 80's
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the 26 in-inch rim whee-eels
Look so good with your 6-inch heels
Fly shit that you be on
Gucci on, aligned by Louis Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I, like Mercury
Why do I mention the solar system?
Cause, you in my soul and system
And we gon' take her home with this one
I got something that you gon' like
You got something that I can't fight
We got something that we both gon' ride

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because...
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
Think of it every second, I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time, I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession won't let me leave

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because...
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

[Outro: Ne-Yo]
Ain't no doubt, so strung out
Ain't no doubt, so strung out
Over you, over you, over you
Because of you
And it's all because of you
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug, she's the sweetest drug

("Breaking up") We can make it better
("Breaking up") We can make it better

("Make It Up") We can make it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Somebody told me Delta's brown-skinned, AKA's light-skinned
And they supposed to be bougie, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'ma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hype man"
Last year a nigga hit her, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightenin', but

[Chorus: Kanye West (Tony Williams)]
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
The night fallin' over Brooklyn where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth like I'm comin' out the mouths of babes
One foot in and one foot out the grave, niggas want they reparations, how you calculate the amount to be paid?
You try to imagine America without the slaves (The slaves)

[Chorus: Kanye West (Tony Williams)]
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Good looks, Ye! Her tenement, yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold bullion because she went and protested
'Cause her best friend's man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a Glock
In the hood is an everyday happenin'
In front of the precinct, she chews out the captain
She yells out, "Why y'all do this to black men?" C'mon

[Chorus: Kanye West (Tony Williams)]
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it

[Verse 4: Common]
I think of eighty-seven ways to make better days
Whether crime or rhyme, I heard the rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
The music, ridin' it good like Escalades
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggas wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinkin' big like Lil Wayne and Tha Carters's that-

[Chorus: Kanye West (Tony Williams)]
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it

[Verse 5: Rhymefest]
C'mon, look
Tell people the truth, but never give 'em your true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Patriot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnnie Cochran dead, who gonna get us "Us free" now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Who gon' make it better for the thugs in the penal?
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile?
Oh, it's G.O.O.D. Music, yeah, dawg, I see now

[Chorus: Kanye West (Tony Williams)]
We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it

 

[Kanye West]
I'd rather just let the music speak for itself. You know, it's like, I was happy to be in a situation where people couldn't say, oh, I was trying to promote my own song. For the times that I've, like, defended myself...

I'm pushing the envelope! I wrote my fuckin' 'Run This Town' verse for a fuckin' month! When I heard Eminem's verse on the Drake shit, I went back and rewrote my shit for two days. I canceled appointments to rewrite! I fuckin' care! You know what I'm saying? And that's what I'm saying. Because I did that, Taylor Swift cannot win over Beyoncé! Because I wrote my verse in two days, Taylor Swift cannot beat Beyoncé. As long as I'm alive! And if I'm alive, kill me then! Kill me then! As long as I'm alive, you gon' have to deal with it. Cause there ain't gonna be no more motherfucking Elvises with no James Browns

[Female voice]
Why are you so angry? What's the anger?

[Kanye West]
Because my mother got arrested for the fuckin' sit-ins. My mother died for this fame shit! I moved to fuckin' Hollywood chasing this shit. My mother died because of this shit. Fuck MTV

It ain't no love. What the fuck was Pink performing? Don't nobody know that song. Pink performed twice! Two songs? How the fuck Pink perform twice and I didn't even get asked to perform "Heartless." "Heartless" is the biggest song of the year! It had the most spins of the first quarter! I don't know that Pink song! But I noticed that she's pink! They put me in a fuckin' room and projected it

[Male voice]
How the fuck did Eminem get the Best Hip-Hop song in 2008?

[Kanye West]
Eminem won Best Video! Rap Video! Yo, when he won that shit, I was so happy. I was so happy I ran all this shit. I said, "Nigga, I'm gon' do this until y'all put a bullet in my head. I'm runnin' up to y'all, put a..." [tape cuts]

 

[Hook 1]
They gossiping, it runs the city
They don't know who watchin them when they comin to get me
So I hit the block and bend, do about sixty
And I put my Glocks to them, like blaow, blaow, blaow

[Verse 1]
I'm finna get on this TV and put shit down
I ain't finna let these light skinned niggas come back in style
I'm finna turn this class clown shit to crazy G's
They told my Momma I was bipolar, had A.D.D
I told 'em w-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller
The dream spoilers'll fool ya
Hating on you to their mans on the corners
Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner
They are the virus that corrupts the soul
They are the cubic zirconia inside the ten-karat gold
That get green on you, when you get green on 'em
You gotta wash your hands of 'em, get clean on 'em
Somebody told me success is the best revenge
So they gon' be fucked up when you do your thing on 'em
Now hold your plaques high, like who would've thought?
And tell em *ahem ahem ahem*, thank you for your no support

[Hook 2]
They are the dream killers, they the dream killers
Who know a dream? Uh, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)
They the dream killers, they the dream killers
Dream, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)

[Verse 2]
Now how you going to talk about the way I spend my money?
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money
And they know they hating, but what they don't know is
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration
'Cause we the leaders and they the followers
And we the nut busters and they the swallowers
They are the rumors, they are the lies
We are the shit, dog, and they the flies
How you gonna tell me how to live my life?
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right?
They are the misery that loves company
'Cause that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me
Told 'em I finished school, then I started my own business
They said, "Oh you graduated?" Nah, I decided I was finished
Chasing y'all dreams and what you got planned
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned
And they hate on your relationship then break your marriage up
Can't kill your dreams so they assassinate your character
Do anything to downplay you or embarrass you
Come around with you but they ain't down with you
They the dream killers

[Instrumental Break]

(Killer Norman Bates)

[Verse 3]
And I'm through spitting these rappers my most heartfelt flow
'Cause they be like, "That's cool, you got some beats for me though?"
Oh, I get it, you want to be Snoop and Dr. Dre
But don't nobody give a fuck what you got to say
Anyway, what you finna rap about?
You never sold crack out your house or put a gat to a mouth
Or put your fist to your spouse, so how you gon' move the crowd?
I bet a thousand that you get booed out
I even heard that they even taking wagers in jail
They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail
Second you talk about peace, they gon' be like, "Peace?"
This nigga came from the Chi, moved to the East
You gotta kill at least one person at least
Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease
How you go to New York? What, you ain't never took a tour there?
What, you ain't know you gotta be rich just to be poor there?
The dream killers

[Hook 1]
They gossiping, it runs the city
They don't know who watchin them when they comin to get me
So I hit the block and bend, do about sixty
And I put my Glocks to them, like blaow, blaow, blaow

 

[Hook: John Legend]
Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me little homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cos she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said "It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me"
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that platinum and gold for me!"
But if you really cared for her
Then yiy woulda never hit the airport and followed ya dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seem like she talkin bout me
She said, "You left ya kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin bout, what niggas tryin to do, just not new"
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds, spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin about Chi-Town

[Hook: John Legend]

 

COMING SOON (INSHALLAH)

 

[Intro: Kanye West & Young Thug]
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
High lights
Tell everybody I'm back in town
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
High lights

[Hook: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights

[Post-Hook: TWF Tony Williams]
I wanna play with you all night long
Then after tonight

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, I don't know
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro

[Hook: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be only be highlights

[Post-Hook: TWF Tony Williams]
I wanna play with you all night long
Then after tonight (slow motion)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I bet me and Ray J would be friends
If we ain't love the same bitch
Yeah, he might have hit it first
Only problem is I'm rich

[Interlude: Carole King & Kanye West]
You've got to get up every morning
You've got to get up every morning
I live my life on the highlights
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world that you've got love in your heart
Oh no, gotta play this shit back

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
And eventually there's gon' be so many niggas
[?] pool party on the weekend, that's the business
There's one white girl told me she hate white cock
That's when I knew hip hop was the new rock
When you know you gotta keep your business zip-loc'd
Cause the nigga still got her Gucci flip-flops
[?] take her on a c-cold adventure
Old bitches know I put the dick on they dentures
Might tell 'em Lexington Steele is my mentor
Famous people act so damn pretentious, huh?
What she need is an hour of some inches, huh?
Got a thick dick hopping on some trenches, huh?
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches. huh?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian, huh?
She spent a whole check on some Christians, huh?
And that bitch ain't even religious, huh?
I'm respected, I'm way too prestigious
Y'all motherfuckers throwing bows like Riddick
Crack coke, crack sale, white niggas got mail
Might drop a baby line and call that shit Pastel
Walkin', livin', breathin', god, you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Bad bitches fuckin' Rob, though he overweight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back
Hah, huh, what you want?
Want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack?
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not

[Sample: Jen Selter]
(I love social media, I love fitness and I love photography)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I need at least seven days with Chloe Sevigny
Since I saw Brown Bunny, it ain't never been the same
I ain't gon' tell ya that I've never been a lame, but
Ever since with Hov, I got that Roc-A-Fella chain
Man, shit just changed, shit just changed
My nigga Dame said let's get this change
Get this thing, iPhone thing
[?] then I hit

[Hook: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be only be highlights

[Post-Hook: TWF Tony Williams]
I want to play with you all night long
Then after the night
I want to play with you all night long
Then after the night

[Hook: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be only be highlights

[Intro]
Let me get more volume
Nah, nah
Louder than my voice

[Verse]
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know, I know, I know when I see it
Riding down the 405, baby
Pacing, thinking, to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Don’t know why, but I know a sign when I see it

 

[Kanye West]
I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin'
You can ask Ibn, we be straight mackin'
Y'all work at IBM, hotels they be in
Ooh la la, tres bien magnifique
Any street

Father is the black Bruce Wayne
Only shorty in preschool rockin' two chains

If you talkin' 'bout marriage, you mean multi-million heiress

 

[Pusha T]
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birdseye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons no room for George
Yeh, the Fear of God’s in you muthafuckers
This art imitate my life
You WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation hype
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through her Bachelor's
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villian like candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what’s my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change

[Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
And sold your dreams, you don’t know who did it
I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it
I need more drinks and more lights
Hot American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Its like a crip said: “I got way too many blues for any more bad news”
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don’t believe in yesterday
What’s a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I’m got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m going after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowing up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, its like that ya’ll
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

[Pusha T]
Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me
The making of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I’m drawing from both sides, I’m Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what’s inside this pinata
And rolling kilos in gymstrada is one saga
One chapter of black magic, I’m Harold Potter
Feels like I’m doomed to dealing with women whom
Relationships with their fathers won’t allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome
But adios I blow my own dice before I toss ‘em, loss ‘em
Some other muthafuckers double crossed ‘em
Tryna snatch my nigga back I blew a small fortune
Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I’m muthfucking Gorgeous, wooooooooo
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih
Whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But the devil red, tires double tread
I’m posting parks up. that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look what the devil did
Yeah

[Kanye West]
It’s hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention
As long as I’m in Polo’s they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
And I assisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, fans can't resist it
Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!

Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
[Louder]
Broke, broke broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi-

[Leader]
I've called this private meeting today because there is an imposter among us
There is an imposter among us
This brother right here has been out making beats on the side, yes he has
Pretending he's broke walking amongst us
This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day
Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us
I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes
I found new shoes!
Kanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?!

[Kanye (stammering)]
I was-you crazy, I wasn't, I didn't, um, I was just um, I was-

[Leader]
No, you speak up, brother!

[Leader]
What?! You march your new shoes out of here, Kanye. Don't you ever come back in 'em. Don't you ever come back smellin' all good, taking showers and shit like that, alright? We don't appreciate that down here at Broke Phi Broke

What's next?

 

McDonalds Man
McDonalds Man
The french fries had a plan
The french fries had a plan
The salad bar and the ketchup made a band
Cus the french fries had a plan
The french fries had a plan

McDonalds Man
McDonalds
I know them french fries have a plan
I know them french fries have a plan
The cheeseburger and the shakes formed a band
To overthrow the french fries plan
I always knew them french fries was evil man
Smelling all good and shit
I don't trust no food that smells that good man
I don't trust it
I just can't

McDonalds Man
McDonalds Man
McDonalds, damn
Them french fries look good though
I knew the Diet Coke was jealous of the fries
I knew the McNuggets was jealous of the fries
Even the McRib was jealous of the fries
I could see it through his artificial meat eyes
And he only be there some of the time
Everybody was jealous of them french fries
Except for that one special guy
That smooth apple pie

 

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and quit playin' with that bitch

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & (Kanye West)]
Too fresh, man, to be a class clown
Graduated when I sat down
They don't want you to show your ass
Had the Yeezy spazzes in the background (bitch)
Let's talk about the Raf now
Let's talk about the stash now
Hella niggas send my ho's up
All you bitches get passed down (bitch)
Every now and then, on the Act, wow
Maybe sing a little, bitch, I act wild
Bitches rubbing on me like a frat child
On London town, bitches packed down (bitch)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man you got to hate it
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man, I'm motivated

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, you got to hate it, man, I'm motivated
Man, I'm underrated, over-overstated
Rappin' over thirty, talkin' out related
That's captivated, Grammy nominated
Your shit outdated, my shit upgraded
Your shit outdated, my shit upgraded

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man I'm motivated
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man, I'm motivated

 

[Lyrics from Snippet]

See this in 3D
For life start for me, for life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
80 degrees
Warming up the heat
I did it for you
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you
I can float on the finer
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

 

[Intro: Kanye West]
I've been waiting for a minute
Pour out, ayy
For my lady, and I

[Hook: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Verse: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Had more than another episode
Last time I was down in Mexico
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in a Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have to laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I...

[Pre-Hook: Travis Scott]
Wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let 'em get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me

[Hook: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Outro: Section 25 & Kanye West]
See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Nah, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
See through the veil
And forget all your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Oh, life's a feeling, yeah
Oh, the body's a feeling, yeah
The future is uncertain
For us all, just stop
Why make things worse?
Why make things worse?

 

[Hook]
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
Much more, much more than this
I did it my way...

[Verse 1]
It go my way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The ROC got 'Ye, but they ain't snortin' it
They just got him up at Baseline recordin' shit
Yeah I've been broke, now I'm good, bitch
I ain't no Kennedy, but I'm hood rich
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else, thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I've been beaten, but never broken through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though, we needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white
Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us like we almost white
Almost

[Hook]


[Verse 2]
It go my way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway
Niggas wanna diss K on their local mix-tapes
There they go again, lyin' to consumers
Get they hair cut in the Little Shop of Rumors
You lil' sloppy with your cockiness ain't ya?
A little arrogant with all your comparisons
Cause as far as the Chi, I got the most plaques
Since the beginnin' of rap and nah, y'all ain't mentionin' that
Y'all just talk about my dough, how I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eatin', shut your pie hole
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though?
Why? Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro!
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?
Only difference between you and me, you were gay
Awww, did he get his feelin's hurt?
Nawww, he's got titties under his shirt

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It go my way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway
When you walk straight, niggas tend to look at you sideways
I say, fuck that, dog, I get my own way
Niggas ain't believe me, 'til they see me on TV
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway
Then pass her to Freeway, just like it's a relay
We stay four stars or better
Cause the couches in the rooms got more leather
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress Ardjo, but only pay partial
Stay gettin' somethin' off layaway at Marshall's
Polo and Carbesher's, we into them things dawg
Back in '96, we was livin' like kings dawg
40 cal.s or better, tottin' them things dawg
So up the Turkish snake, and take them rings off

[Hook]

 

[Intro: Kanye West & Quavo]
When I came up had to show my ass, yeah
Clothes tight, clothes tight, holds tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
And I just figured out the whole time
Uh, I was actin' like I'm white

[Verse 1: Quavo & Kanye West]
When I came up, had to show my ass, yeah, that's the black side
I was trappin' out the bando, nosy ass neighbors uptight
When I come around, when I come around, niggas don't act right
I'm yellin' out, "Please don't come with that fake shit," screamin' it all night
What the fuck did you say? What the fuck did you say? (ayy, uh)
I'm on my Wraith shit, I'm on my, I'm on my Wraith shit (race, yep, woo)
Get the fuck out my face, get out of my way (move, fuck did you say?)
I'm on my Wraith shit, I fell in love with all races (race, yep)
When you're aiming for something I tell 'em
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
When you're aiming for something I tell 'em
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
When you're aiming for something I tell 'em
Hold tight, see that melody right there? That's why I'm me
When you're aiming for something I tell 'em

[Verse 2: Kanye West & (Quavo)]
I be actin' like I'm white (white)
Fuckin' white bitches, black and white dick (oh, ayy)
[?] like we don't tiki talk shit, bossed up
100 bump, I do that shit all night
Sniff a line
I be sniffing Miley Cyrus with Miley Cyrus
In a bathroom with my thumb in her ass
Now I'm actin' like I'm white

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West  & Quavo]
You stayed 3 exes up and you never came to see me in my own room
You the only good enough for the mountain
Only good as the people you got around you
This is all associations around you
I only got [?] but never doubt you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Please forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Please forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Please forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you

[Chorus: Quavo]
Ayy, 'cause I'm actin' like I'm white
Don't make me show my ass, that's the black side
Yeah, I'm actin' like I'm white
Don't make me show my ass, that's the black side
'Cause I'm actin' like I'm white
Don't make me show my ass, that's the black side
Yeah, I'm actin' like I'm white
Don't make me show my ass, that's the black side

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I'm chillin', pourin' up until I can't feel my anger
Blessed my nigga Yeezy with a banger
I was sharin' all my thoughts with a stranger
Wrestle this bitch like Kurt, no Angle
I can see them diamonds drippin' off me like a sink
Act inside a pineapple mango
She been in the [?] with no angle
Whoop, I'm adios, as-salamu alaykum (nigga, that that)
I just want a round house, we gon' have 'em bleedin'
Nah, I ain't green, sharin' is carin', bae, I be just feedin'
Coca Cola shape, I don't want to fuck it bae, I just want see it
Lil nigga late, I been done did but you just ain't see it
Wait, lil' nigga, I can afford it
I just was broke with no shawty
I just found out it's important
To take off the factories and put on some Forgies
I got six rings, I'm just lordin'
I used to be broke and so boring (broke, borin', yeah)
I came out that swamp, can't ignore it (yeah)
Now all my pockets is on Norbit

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
They mad 'cause we grinded up from the top
I was on the block, no guap, runnin' from cops
They talk about me, they wanted to see the album flop
And we will never stop, the game on Buscemi lock
I do wrong and do right, forgive me for not livin' right
Sippin' on Bud, like givin' you advice I'm actin' white
Mansion on acres, my white friends I only invite
Even when I'm wrong, it feel like a nigga right

[Verse 5: Quavo]
Dr. King sacrificed his life (King)
Because they didn't treat us right (no)
Don't call a young nigga racist because my best friend white (white)
Yeah, my best friend's white (ayy), white (uh)

[Verse 6: Offset]
I was actin' like I'm white (white)
Diamonds shinin' off the lights (shine)
Pain came with the limelight (pain)
Feds put me in the spotlight (feds)
Mama told me that these bitches ain't never gon' count (these bitches don't count)
'Cut you off, don't wanna talk, I'ma see you around (I see you around)
This is the way that we kick it (we kick it)
200 thou' in my kitchen (200 racks)
Bad bitches in the facility (bad bitches)
I put my hoe on a mission (ayy)
Y'all niggas better hold tight (hold tight)
I gave 200 to Jews, told 'em make it right (make it right)
They mad, we blew up like dynamite (mad)
I can see everythin' like a satellite (I can see)

 

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah - I used to front when I write songs
Talk about havin ice on, and I could barely keep my lights on
And my beats was so sick, I shoulda got a medic
But my credit was so pathetic I couldn't afford a debit
When The Dropout dropped, I had to cop me a money tree
To front on anybody who ever tried to front on me
With so much personality, what do you want from me?
I could be by myself and enjoy the company
My life, this year, my career, is the Lord
Bad chick, this award, is for Melyssa Ford
'94 I could only afford this Accord
From the home of gangbangin and we all outdoors
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Eastside, right B-Side, Lakeshore Drive
And I'm (and I'm) Chi-Town's finest
Where you at? The whole city behind us

[Hook: Kanye West]
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Where you at? The whole city behind us

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It ain't nuttin to it but to do it! I came here
To shut the place down 'til my body stops pumpin red fluid
A-Town I've been through it! And we steady gettin tested
But ready to fill your bubble when we put the lead to it
Out West they still bangin, up top it's really gully
Down South we get buck and turn hearts to Silly Putty
Ludacris I got silly money - you got jokes?
I'll be laughin all the way to the bank - now that's really funny!
Big city bright lights - and many pity cause we like fights
May be long days but it's fright nights
Living out the night life - and people asking 'Where You At?'
Not the club; I stay in the get right!
Hotlanta home of the booties and the really tight skirts
Where if somebody moves then somebody gets hurt!
From Decatur down to CP, and EP
Adamsville to the battlefield it's D.T.P

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The-Game]
It's Compton's prodigy
Obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics
Where they tie bandanas around the steerin column
Of Impalas in to get holla
We fightin pitbulls and Rottweilers
In the projects the objective is make dollars
'Where You At?' It ain't a problem to get it there by tomorrow
Cause I got a female friend, with frequent flier mileage
I ain't never been to college, got the IQ of a Rhodes Scholar
If you follow G-Unit throw up your dubs and yell holla
To all the Y.G.s in khakis and white tees
With And 1's in every color like Ice-T
I might be the city of Compton's right knee
The way I paint pictures with these hip-hop scriptures
Pay attention while The Game shine like a prism
Glisten, show you how canaries can alter one's vision
Not to mention I am Dr. Dre christened on behalf
Of Luda and Kanyeezy, I'm gon' breathe easy

[Hook] - repeat 2X

 

[Intro]
Now you know you gotta turn this super loud
C'mon now, let's go, uh

[Chorus]
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, uh, let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know you're wondering, how is Kanye spittin' so hot?
'Cause I listen to the Roc and I listen and watch
And the first thing I copped was a glistening watch
Off that Blueprint money, yeah, I know I'm a dummy
But what I'm supposed to tell a girl in the club
While that ass is getting feeled on
What, I bought a couple build-ons?
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain than my real one
'Cause on the real, son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuck and smoke
If you paid then she's thinking 'bout her children, feel him?
Probably not though, 'less you got dough, you know what I mean
You would think the grass greener when you finally get green

[Chorus]
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay

[Verse 2]
Man, I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years, ain't picked a career
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and

[Chorus]
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay

[Verse 3]
Man, I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this!"
And I refuse go to the grocery store
Without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a Coupe

[Chorus]
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay

[Outro]
And uh, I decided to stop fuckin' with y'all
Uh, wack ass niggas
And, uh, hatin'-ass, dream killin'-ass niggas
And since I quit
Everyone that supported me, thank you very much
And everyone that doubted me, thank you very little

 

[Kanye West - Alternative Second Verse]
The brown hero, live from Ground Zero
Machine gun flow, made of ghetto Ross Perot
And this is disestablishmen-tarianism
With my night goggles on, yeah, military vision
And it’s still a very Christian way to think about livin’
When you prayin’ for freedom ’cause your mind been in prison
‘Cause they tryin’ to control every single big decision
You ain’t effin’ the system, then why the eff is you livin’?
Look, dawg, you can cop whatever suits you on
Three-piece, cuff links and the accoutrements
They been feedin’ us ish without the nutrients
So I’m back with another hit to let the truth be known
And your boy still fresh with the Gucci on
Them Italians sure know how to make what the moulies want
And they really can’t take what dude be on
But I be on the same thing ’til you prove me wrong

 

[Intro: Rihanna + (Kanye West)]
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
(Swizz told me let the beat rock)

[Verse 1: Kanye West + (Swizz Beatz)]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)
They mad they're still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (God damn)
Yeah we still hood famous

[Hook: Rihanna + (Swizz Beatz)]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
(Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!)
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Good God
Midwest coast back nigga
And don't say nigga unless of course you black nigga
Free country they say that shit in Tennessee
'Cause I got all they white daughters drinking Hennessy
I'ma go to Sal's, put some niggas on a wall
I might go to Oz take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano so involved
I know
King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had 2 polos
We the kids they keep in the back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent, go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They askin' bout the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff

[Bridge: Sister Nancy + (Swizz Beatz)]
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
'ey what a bam bam
(How you feeling right now? Let me see your lighters in the air)
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
Bam bam eh
Bam bam, bam bam

Bam bam dilla, bam bam
(I wanna see everybody hands in the air like this)
'ey what a bam bam
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam

[Outro: Nina Simone]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

[Produced by Kanye West, Charlie Heat, Havoc & Noah Goldstein]

 

This the heart of the muthafuckin city. Act like y'all ain't have the muthafuckin Clipse album and shit. Act like y'all ain't based your whole shit your whole lifestyle off this nigga Pusha T. Everything is Pusha T. Pyrex vision, that's Pusha T. Fear of God, that's Pusha T. This nigga the heart of the muthafuckin culture, for you culture vultures. This the only nigga spittin that wild muthafuckin hip hop shit, right now. That's why I stand next to this nigga. I don't give a fuck about none of these corporations, none of these fucking sellouts. This is muthafucking Pusha T

This is what the fuck we make. We make good music. We make good music. We don't give a fuck about how much god damn money you make. We make good music. I'm a little ... off that Goose right now. I might get loose right now

We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck! Nigga this is that culture. This is that culture. For everybody stealin the culture. For all the niggas tryna do they camo prints at Magic. This muthafuckin Pusha T. All the niggas tryna extend they t-shirts, tryna throw numbers on the back. This muthafuckin Pusha T

... and I got numbers on the back of my shit - FUCK YOU! This DONDA. This Matt Williams. This Virgil Abloh. This Ferris Bueller. This muthafuckin Pusha T

 

This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'mma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gonna be some different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?

Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different
Cute little college chick, lining up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Ain't that a true bitch?
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you how to do this shit

Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyoncé, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says "is that Jesus?"
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's

Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened

Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits? Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'mma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsay Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say fuck getting them D's, I'mma just ride out with these

 

[Hook]
That new Rihanna in the front
Bitches in the back they don't like me though
Why? I can tell you 'bout stupid hoes
Why? I bet she don't act stupid though

[Verse 1]
Cuz I cut a bitch
I fuck a bitch, go and find another bitch
And I never trust a bitch
You done touched a nigga 30 times
On some baby mother shit
Talkin' bout you celibate
But you still suckin' dick
This that half a brick, quarter brick
Aye, come and place your order bitch
More of that gutter shit

[Hook]
New Rihanna in the front
Bitches in the back, she don't like me though
Why? I don't know, she might be broke
Why? I can tell you bout stupid hoes
Why? I bet she don't act stupid though

[Verse 2]
She know that I have sex with 'em
If you tryin' get lit then go ahead light it ho
What you bitches fightin' for?
Nah, I can't even that’s why you can't sit with us
You need to just sit your ass down
I heard you fucked that nigga well I fucked that nigga too
And they probably didn't tell you that’s what suckers niggas do
And if he had a chance with me he would have never fucked with you

[Hook 2]
Cause that New Rihanna in the front (Bitch)
Bitches in the back, they don't like me though
Why? Side piece 'bout to let wifey know
Why? Thirsty hoes is tryin' get chose
Why? I bet she don't act stupid though

[Bridge]
Cut that bitch in the bathroom
Cut that bitch in the bathroom
I cut that bitch in the bathroom
I cut that bitch in the bathroom
I bet you need to quit playin', quit playin' with me bro

[Outro]
Got a nigga fucked up up in here
You know I'm sayin?
A bitch say she don't like me, you ask her why, she go
“I don't know,” just like some shit stupid bitches say
KnowImsayin?
(Look, I can't even deal with this shit right now. This bitch is crazy, she must have lost her fucking mind. I'm tired of going back and forth with this ho. What the fuck? I can't even deal. Who the fuck does this bitch think she is?)

 

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can you be? (way up)

[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I got that gold stuff stuck on my back
I got that now I can't get that back
I got that gold stuff stuck on my back
I got that now I can't get that back

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
¿Cómo eres? Subale
Come on in I'm super paid
Song for song I'm due by day
Just got off now I'm suitless
Watch how you talk to me
Now I need y'all to hear this
I need a 100 racks
That's just my talking fee
Just playin'

Ain't been lost as me

[Chorus: Kanye West]

I got that now I can't get that back
I got that gold stuff stuck on my back
I got that now I can't get that back

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I caught a wave
Caught more air than Super Dave
Call Aaliyah, I'm super paid
Jet lag, and tryna recuperate
Just got off the flight from Budapest
Don't need Khaled, just say "you the best!"
You the type of nigga to shop at Uniqlo
Just found out my father-in-law unisex
Running out of money, running into debt
Running from bill collectors, I ain't pay them yet
Shit you did, with no matter how rich you get
And even more, depending on the bitch you get
I be getting worried for my niggas getting married, seriously

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
Will you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)

[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I got that gold stuff stuck on my back
I got that now I can't get that back

 

This was founded years ago
By broke slaves, years ago
Who did not have, years ago
By broke brothas in the 20s, years ago
Who did not have when we could not eat
Hmm, remember that?
Eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? Hmm?
Do you remember all those Christmases when your mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh?
Remember that?

 

If you ever see somebody next to me, know that they're better than me at something

So -- bars. Bars

So it's really good to have this event tonight which we decided instantaneously, the way we put this shit together, y'all comin' out here tonight vibin' with us. In the way this whole albums put together. The amount of producers that came together for it and the way we worked on this shit really collectively, collaboratively. We didn't give a fuck about what nobody else said outside lookin' in, anything. We just wanted to make the best product possible. And this is just the beginning of an entirely new mentality of how to make music directed for the people. What I said last night is like, we drop this shit June 18th. This ain't about waitin' until August and havin' some big this and that. It's about deliverin' some shit for y'all to go to work to, ride to, listen to while y'all workin' out and shit. Whatever y'all doin' to provide a soundtrack for this shit that's gon' come out. We gon' keep on doin' this shit over and over and over. Makin' shit for my core, my cut

With the creative director Matt Williams and Virgil Abloh, the whole team, Don C, Ibn, all the Been Trill family, and the combination of all the people we brought together from Daft Punk workin' like 3-4 joints on the album. The first joint "Onsite", "I Am A God", bless me, and Mike Dean. Travis Scott workin' on the album, Hudson Mohawke, Arca. And of course, at the end, last -- wait a second, am I forgettin' some people and shit?

Last, but not last, that came and helped bring this whole shit together, the executive producer of this LP and the family, is Rick Rubin comin' in and finishing up the whole shit for us. Which is legendary because everything we did on this project, everything I get like when we release 'Numbers on the Boards", from the video to the "NO ARTWORK" to the sound of the song and everything. I was like, "What would Rick Rubin do? What was his Def Jam shit that they were doing?" Because I remember like Ricky would say, "When we did Def Jam, we wasn't really feelin' like we was in competition with nobody, cause this shit was so direct." Where we at right now? We in the middle of the city right now, over into the motherfuckin' streets and nobody shuttin' down shit while we makin' real music and yall vibin out to this shit.. So it's good for me to go to the God, Rick Rubin, and play him my shit. Ask him questions and allow him to take this project to an entirely new level and he made a lot of great decisions at the end and brought it to a whole new level. And I wanted to explain something about the title Yeezus

Simply put: West was my slave name and Yeezus is my god name

 

Oh niggas must think I'm not petty cause I'm the best that's ever made music

Like, oh that's Ye and I can put his wife's initials on my twitter   @Wizkhalifa

Bro first of all you stole your whole shit from Cudi

Second, your first single was corny as fuck and most there after

Work hard play hard
You have distracted from my creative process

I went to look at your twitter and you were wearing cool pants

I screen grabbed those pants and sent it to my style team #Wizwearscoolpants

3rd no one I know has ever listened to one of your albums all the way through

4th you let a stripper trap you

5th    I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years

6th  don't ever come out the side of your neck at me

7th I am your OG    and I will be respected as such

8th  I made it so we could wear tight jeans

9th   me and Cudi created this shit

10th   don't you ever in your fucking life speak sideways about a nigga that's fighting for us    I do this for all of us

11th   I showed you respect as a man when I met you

12th   You wouldn't have a child if it wasn't for me

13th   You own waves????  I own your child!!!!

14th   Nigga it's called creativity    #youshouldtryitsomeday

15th   Nigga I tried to call you and you changed your number

16th   don't even hint at mentioning me my family or my wife   I am your OG

17th   I think you dress cool      I wish I was skinny and tall

Maybe I couldn't be skinny and tall but I'll settle for being the greatest artist of all time as a consolation

Don't ever ever ever come out the side of your mutherfucking neck bro or bruh or   however you say it Mr. Waves

I'm YE     and I ain't gotta say it the right way      I'm Ye  I'm Ye  I'm Ye  I'm Ye I'm Ye I'm Ye I'm Ye

[Intro]
Yo, this sound like some movie shit, right?
Get your popcorn, get your condiments
You don't wanna miss nothing, okay, listen

[Verse 1]
They call me Edward Scissorhands 'cause I'm trying to cut
She claim she got cramps, I'm gon' get you to suck
And you not gon' use your teeth, you hear?
You gon' find out What Lies Beneath right here
The Preacher's Wife don't give head, get a divorce, man
The Kids been calling you the headless horseman
Like Sleepy Hollow, see she swallow
Suck like ol' girl, got booed at Apollo 13, Ghosts
Use my Hollow Man for Friday 13th
You be Ghost, Backdraft from the toast
Niggas who drop names is oh so shameless
Get a chain that's stainless, they Almost Famous
My bling got 'em calling me Lord of the Rings
The Shining make it hard for her to Do The Right Thing
But I Don't Say a Word, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell

[Refrain]
And I'm living a movie, not living by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
One, two, Ye coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, never sleep again

[Verse 2]
Shit's deeper than the Sleepers
The Jeeper Creep up on your block and cops Clock-us
Try to Baller Block-us, use Absolute Power
You gave him 9½ Weeks, why you trying to Rush Hours, huh?
And in The Cell don't drop soap in the showers, huh
They try to give me Life, I'm out in an hour, huh
Back on the block with more Juice than Pac
Making mo' money 'cause of The-The-The-The Roc

[Refrain]
And I'm living a movie, not living by rules
Yo, what you talking about, man?
One, two, Ye coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, never sleep again

[Outro]
I said some shit like, umm
If you in my things, you Suicide Kings
There's only Three Kings, Me, Myself and Irene
You know what I'm saying?

 

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'll leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So, put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

[Hook: Kanye West]
Drive slow homie
Drive slow
You never know homie, about these hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawlin'? You see them screens fallin'?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jammin' on this Screw
I'm looking for them hoes baby, what it do? Drive slow homie

[Interlude: GLC & Kanye West]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (drive slow homie)
If you're ridin' round the city with nowhere to go (drive slow homie)
Live today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know homie, might need some hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby this evidence
You see a player flicking and how you ain't convinced
That you should gon kiss it, just a lil bit
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip-toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil homie drive slow

(Tony Williams harmony ad-libs)

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Looking at life through my rearview, all the problems I had
Could be seen a lot clearer after time had passed
Known for living so fast, they wonder how he don't crash
With 220 on the dash, and he constantly mashin'
"Why don't he slow down?" they be constantly askin'
But me in the fast lane is like metal and magnets
Now I ain't trying to say that this the way of the masses
But it's so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion
Since me and C were cuttin' class, and showin' our ass
Shooting out in broad day in the middle of traffic
I remember sellin' crack faster than I could bag it
Just sharin' my past wit ya shawty, I ain't e'en braggin'
Me and Cap got life, them other folk got blasted
Had a partner O.D. and after this all happened
Life the only thing that kept a pimp from crying and laughing
Then the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness
I never thought that I'da made it this far rappin'
For introducing the youth to what we now call "trappin'"
Considered now a classic, who'd've imagined?
Me in Milano getting models in next year's fashion
So nowadays, they can call me old-fashioned
But it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashin'
So I guess the moral of this here class is:
Life about who make it, not about who make it the fastest
Drive slow homie

[Outro: Kanye West (Chopped & Screwed)]
Yeah, bumpa bumpa bump bump
Drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
You never know homie, might need some hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie
Drive slow homie

 

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wish all wack niggas'd get out the game
You can't con me, that’s half my name
And if you had any brains you wouldn't wanna lose half your brain
By hating on players in the game
Wack nigga, the beat go, “Duh-duh-da”
And then your flow go way the fuck off
I kill y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
But I'm not trying to cause commotion
And have my niggas bring all the toast in
I just want your girl to rub my balls with lotion
'Cause you got madder, ripped down all my posters
But you came at me like "Yo, I got the Kia with the woodgrain"
Yeah you would, lame
"On the real, in the streets I got the good name
"I got the TV" Yeah, that’s good, man

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip your frame up
Asking if I'm nice, like fucking with a chick that don't give head
That's a no-brainer
Niggas pack bangers y'all don't even know the names of
I’m about to meet the quota, you about to meet the savior
Wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got
Word, not that I'm wilding or even promoting violence
It's just you fucking up my high, can't a nigga smoke in silence?
You wack niggas

[Hook: Kanye West & Talib Kweli]
Wake up in the morning, dawg, you just a wack niggas
I'd kill myself if I was that wack niggas
Everything you wear and rock is just wack niggas
Even if you flossing rocks, you just wack niggas
You can't do it, dawg, you's a wack niggas
Biting ass, bitch ass, trick ass wack niggas
Even your daughter says, "My Daddy's a–" wack niggas
You wack nigga!

[Bridge: Kanye West]
(In the beginning) Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap, white handle, I got jungle fever
Black Benz, white truck and one two-seater
Wack niggas hold hands and follow the procedure
'Cause I got enough tools that one gon' leave you
If I drop enough dudes, man, one gon' reach you
If they build enough schools, man, one gon' teach you
Kanye the shit, but I ain't trying to be feces-tious

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge: Kanye West]
(In the beginning) Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap, white handle, I got jungle fever
Black Benz, white truck and one two-seater
Wack niggas hold hands and follow the procedure
'Cause I got enough tools that one gon' leave you
If I drop enough dudes, man, one gon' reach you
If they build enough schools, man, one gon' teach you
Kanye the shit, but I ain't trying to be feces-tious

[Outro: Kanye West & Talib Kweli]
Wake up in the morning and dawg, you just a wack niggas
I’d kill myself if I was that wack niggas
Everything you wear and rock is just wack niggas
Even if you flossing rocks, you just wack niggas
Gotta name drop to get a girl naked wack niggas
Plus your ass can't sell one record wack niggas
Even your daughter says, "My Daddy's a–" wack niggas
"My Daddy's a wack nigga"

 

[Verse 1 - Beanie Sigel]
You can't tell me nothing
Gangster? I don't buy it -- you can't sell me nothing
I'm everything you thought I wasn't
Now check out how I does it on this K. West production
All your bullshit, I will flush it
And I got the paper to wipe that ass
Every little song and dance come out, y'all hype that trash
And yo, I'm far from a hater
Cause suckers gotta eat too -- get y'all paper
I ain't mad at cha -- I just can't deal with these fake rappers
Cause most of these niggas wear they boxers backwards
Niggas claim king but can't govern they household
Now real niggas doing time from shit they mouth told
Why dick-eating niggas always rap with a mouth full?
But you know they don't play with me
The realest nigga alive -- what can these niggas say to me? Nothing

[Hook - Kanye West]
La la la la, wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la, then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
I had a dream that Jay and Dame was back together
And in that second, everything was back the same
In reality, your boy went to Mecca, came back
And said that I would never rap again
But I'm back and that's the way the ball bounce
A verse is a ounce, a album's a brick -- now it's time for traffic game
Y'all lame, I am the product
Hotter than lava, they wonder how this Roc-a-fella package came
First you take a brick of Jay, a brick of 'Ye
Couple quarters of Freeway, an ounce of Beans
Then you kill 'em with the flow
We the realest; even Dontrelle Willis couldn't out the team
We speak the truth and they believe us
Tell FEMA even Hurricane Katrina couldn't out the flames
Roc-a-fella here to stay, we airing out y'all lames
Free At Last on the way, so clear 'em out my lane

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
Yeah homie, this the theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
Three hundred dollar jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Lear jet
Fly as the insect even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number cause
When I get my money right, she gon' come running
And I be good like God with a extra "o"
God knows that my check needs some extra O's
And you know that you need to bring some extra
Not in jogging pants, either -- tell 'em wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional and my chain so fresh, they go
But after the fame, did you gain anything?
Damn, 'Ye, would you change anything?
Well, [Young Jeezy: If I had a billion dollars]
I'd cop more pink Polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname "Sorrow"
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
"Wait 'til I get my money" everybody motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything that I wrote
Yeah -- hey mama, they can't hate 'em
Cause after all of the drama, K slayed 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Uncle Murda]
Listen -- I ain't worried 'bout shit
It's a Roc-a-fella/GMG invasion, bitch
You hear them niggas talking 'bout me? Ain't that some shit
These niggas is like bitches -- they all on my dick
They don't want no real G to get in position
I opened up the door so all my real niggas could get in
Roc-a-fella, Def Jam, GMG it's on
Uncle Murda coming for the motherfucking throne
Listen, you could call me the king of New York
You can't front, I'm doing my thing
If it wasn't for the chronic and these bad-ass ho's
I'd be shooting motherfuckers everywhere I go, oh
But the head I be getting got me chilling
Got a nigga like, let me focus on these millions, man
It got me not thinking 'bout these lames
They don't really want no beef, they ain't life-threatening
I'm puffing purple haze with that sour diesel
Can't forget that kush -- I'm high as a eagle
And just cause I'm high off that marijuana
Don't mean I don't see them niggas creeping around the corner
They goners

 

[Intro]
Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of 'em coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go...

[Verse 1]
Every sunset feel righter, sunshines feel brighter
Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer
Feel like God wrote this, I'm just here to quote this
I don't know if you noticed, them accident pictures is bogus
Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'?
I know I almost was the final destination
I musta had a blessin' from Pastor Mason
Cause that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation
And, man, I know I can
Drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne
But, what, I went along with the plan
Paid for my own video, directed by my man
I know God was holdin' my hand
Wouldn't let me go before I went before Def Poetry Jam
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throwin' some vowels
'Bout what we goin' through now
Out the blue girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks
And since the accident, they tellin' me that it's the cheeks
But if you look at history, the last rapper that almost died
Sold 6.5 'cept I'm comin' from the Chi

[Hook]
Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of them coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep
Always thank the Lord
For this mic and my keyboard
Hecky naw that boy is raw

[Verse 2]
Now even though I ain't wired up
We-we-we fired up
You ain't seen my concerts lately, they be linin' up
You ain't seen my girls lately, they be tryin' to cut
And they heard about my girl so I still chill
Cause Monica Lewinsky already killed Bill
And that girl that was with Kobe tried to go for the kill
I think he put it in the wrong Holyfield
Can I take a minute with y'all to be totally real?
Far as my jaw and all, it ain't totally heal
If I would have died, 10/23 of last year
That would have threw a monkey wrench in my whole career
But me, I took the worst thing, turn it into the best thing
I'm from the Chi, I guess it's just a Midwest thing
Times like this make life interesting
Times like this make me count my blessings
Cause you could run around like King of the Chi
But God could take that in a blink of a eye
I remember Cedars-Sinai and all those cryin'
Mama, I'm sorry for almost dyin'
Tell Alwe G and Hip Hop man
Tell Don I'ma John Monopolize the game
Add on Benny Medina, we gon' take 'em to the cleaners
I'm Kanye West, the college dropout slash genius

[Hook]

[Outro]
Now if the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
Throw your diamonds in the air
Throw your diamonds in the air
Now keep 'em in the air
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
We outta here
College Dropout

 

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 1: Twista & New Birth]
Ain't no way that you could pull up to the party
In a Bentley blowing B, gettin' club like this (Oh no)
Ain't no way that you could cook up in the studio
With Kanye and get it jukin' in the club like this
(Oh no, impossible) Ain't no way that you gon' win
Dust some haters off while I'm sippin' on my Henn
Holla at a chick while she sippin' on her gin
And I got the mobsters hollerin' at her friends
(It's impossible) For you to ever be the nicest
You won't get gangsta or get righteous
You ain't never stood on a tip like this
You ain't never stood for no shit like this
(It's just impossible) For you to get it if you don't wanna win
Get up off yo' ass and go for yours, I'm goin' for mine
Now you ain't from the ride what I'm in, know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 2: Twista & New Birth]
It's impossible for you to ever get with me
Because of how I ride on the track
Got the bitch in the back of the Bentley [?]
Used to have the bitch in the back of the Cadillac
(It's just impossible) Niggas always hatin'
Even before I came out with [?]
You be sittin' back and be talkin' your shit
I can't help but I see you though, I don't get it
(It's impossible) Lil' mama, for you to fit all that ass in them jeans
Movin' kinda wilder, turnin' regular jeans into low riders
Tell me, can I be your man?
(It's just impossible) For you to ever deny that I'm about Chi-Town
Represent the city with the deal for twelve years
And sell a couple of mil' and still hold it down, that's impossible

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 3: Kanye West & New Birth]
Get it, roll the weed up and lit it
Smoke a little but don't admit it
Do it like I did, too late, I did it (It's just impossible)
The controversy can't worse me, man
I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and
Thirsty, what is you sayin'?
I got a duel with a couple niggas, that's Thursday, man
Why the hell is I'm worryin'?
Hoppin' out the Benz with the perfect 10
"Man, your life must be perfect, man
Look at how they came up with the perfect plan"
(It's just impossible) It's impossible
Got strip clubs playin' gospitel, flow so sick in the hospital
You know I jammed out like 'Pac'll do
You know you throw your diamonds when I rock with you
Since Michael Jackson made "Rock With You"
I done did shit on Logical
Maybe 'cause we did the impossible
Baby, we done did the impossible

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Outro: New Birth]
It's impossible
It's just impossible
It's impossible

 

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, uh, let's take it back to basics
When shit gets worse, we converse
How we need a new balance
Before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got, if we don't shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I don't wanna have to check you
I'm Chi as Buck-Fiftys and Pelle Pelle leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say, black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough, I'm talkin' bout the cake maid
McDonald's with the flow, served over a billion
You've seen the video, words over the building
Uh, I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give you this feeling
And when the Workout Plan ain't work out, man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner

[Verse 2: Common]
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh
I open my eyes, the corner is like African tribes
The black is subsidized, the black enterprise, the passion arise
The youth fantasize, who got some cash in they eyes
If youth dies, mamas askin' rationalize
Tryna build a spot where ghetto bastards could rise
The ghetto has been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised?
On the corner

 

[Kanye West]
Uh, G.O.O.D. Music, this our year
Backing drums by DJ Premier
Now let me count it down, who the fuck up in here?
Common, Don, Old G, battle rap, oh
Y'all niggas know you can’t really fuck with that
Pusha T, the Clipse just made a classic
Good music together we too Jurassic, you stay plastic
Ramadan with the flow, guaranteed everybody fasting
Big Sean is a don
CyHi Da Prynce
Why you so nervous dog stop being tense
If you ain't talking bout Rash we ain't got nothing in common
Fuck that and that's just common sense what the

[Pusha T]
Came in the game, 8 years prior
8 years later, your mans on fire
My Book of Eli, to all my subscribers
Play the two doors, street car named desire
Came in Grindin’, Ye’ came through the wire
Met at the crossroads, Bone Thugs inspired
1st of the month, Trump to the buyers
Red toupee on the coupe you been fired
Smooth criminal, no prior’s
Man in the mirror, check no liar
Still let that butter fly like Mariah
Show me the money the black Jerry McGuire
Tom Cruise on that couch if that money right
West Hollywood feels like a bunny night
With GOOD company and better jewelers
To the Good Life, we GOOD music

[Big Sean]
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day’s a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I’m pressed clean
Detroit’s angel, I even got red wings
I’m headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life’s prom night and guess who’s the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I’m Don King
Everybody know I’m coming soon like LeBron’s ring
I’m Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter, Sean Combs and Connery all in one
Whoever told you sky’s the limit is looking dumb
Cause I’m 22 and I’m moonwalking on the sun
Oh thats your girl?
She feelin on my whoo there right next to a couple boaters
And she tryna motor boat her and im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor
You might find banana clips ’cause it’s Guerilla warfare
Last year I was watching this from the couch and now I’m here
Thats to let you know what I’m about
Reaper black suit cuz my whole team’s killin'
Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin'
Many tell me I’m the man I ain't made it yet
Tell me who the baddest, I’ll see if I see them naked yet
Won’t stop til I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet

[Cyhi Da Prince]
I’m Mr. Got Bread like Quizno’s
Better known as MJ with the big nose
I swear your artist couldn’t see me on his tip toes
Only on TV I gotta take a quick pose
Let me stop I forgot this was a big show
If being dope made you broke I am piss poor
I’m big poppa plus I’m 2pacalypto
My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for?
Huh, I’m doing this for hip hop
I'm coming after you, him and his spot!
Still tied to the streets like a fish knot
Ain't nothing fake, I’m not a Rolly with a tick tock
Atlanta repper in the home of the yankee
Rosewood suit on with the hanky
I got rich from the zones of the stanky
So everybody know my money long, lanky!
So I’m flexible stretching out my decimals
Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles
Can’t bleep it out cuz there wasn’t nothing sexual
I’m blowing loud, somebody check the decibels
I’m impeccable they put me on the pedestal
And if you bite me, it’s good for you like a vegetable
Shows by the several, schedule full of festivals
And if I ever do time than you know its federal
Uh, incredible, yeah

[Common]
F-f-f-fam fam fam I’ma monster too
You don’t see I do things that the monsters do
The incomparable, remarkable, articles
About my audible technique, my technique
I recognize game like the ESPY’s
Cold to myself I say "God bless me" the truth
So I speak live and directly
You, I will set free my mic is where my check be
Rah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro
Prolly in the metro just so I can get dough
The name is Common but the frame is special
Leave requested from the years I’ve invested
Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope
The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley
Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly

[Kanye West]
The plan was to drink till the pain over
What’s worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake shit, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the world
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God asked Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visitin around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain't finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul
Rosewood we could see her with our eyes closed

It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound

 

[Hook: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
Okay, the hundreds here, [?] Thursday
They ordered champagne, why they look thirsty?
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
Success, and it's time for [?]
It's like the first time back in the basement
[?]
[?]
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Hook: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, body

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Yeah
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody

 

[Mase]
Yeah! Uh

[Kanye West]
(Jesus, Jesus, talk to me)
(Jesus, Jesus, walk with me)
(Jesus, Jesus...)
(Jesus, Jesus...)

[Mase]
This song right here changed my life… come on, come on!

[Hook: Kanye West]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can’t break me down
(Jesus walks with me)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Between the girls and the jewelry
The devil tryin’ lure me, it fury me
(Jesus walks with me)
My pastor's shakin’ his head
He ain’t sure of me, but surely
(Jesus walks with me)
They asked, do you say your prayers at least two a week?
I ain’t talking to God, I know what I’ve been doin’ G
Do you know how I be embarrassed?
My prayers sound like Ben Stiller’s on Meet the Parents
And I ain’t good, what they give us this day
The slaves is trying to give us this free
I’m trying to give us this pay
Man, you know how ‘dem strippers was
We was all ghetto fabulous
All at the rooms in the Sybaris
From this jacuzzi water, can you cleanse us?
Can you please unfog my Cartier lenses?
God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses
For me I almost died, falling asleep in them Benzes
It’s something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And He gives me direction when I can’t decide
He is alive
How can you tell me that He ain't when I said

[Hook]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(I want Jesus)
And now I think there is something that I can say now that'll right my wrongs
(Jesus walks with me)
I finally talked to God, I ain't afraid cause His love is so strong

[Verse 2: Common]
Open your eyes, there's smoke in the skies
The Beast is holdin' a lies
Everywhere we move, motion denied
Emotion derived from posters of pride
Of African, cultures and tribes
Who live when we suppose they die
Laugh when we suppose they cry
The pain we holding inside
Cause all we really know is survive
Use that to remember we're kings
That's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings
And cutless supremes
Seen Diana Ross remember that my sisters is queens
The Lord is coming -- for now, he visit in dreams
For every mission it seems impossible
Speak to the gospel to remind me what God can do
When it's not logical
To those in hospitals and prisons
Low-income living
For them I say a prayer keep giving
Learning to receive
My heart is burnin' to achieve
Even when it's hard to breathe, I still believe that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mase]
Before you take my name, take my fame
While you at it take my shame
Take my flaws, take my blame?
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt
See my bruise, do this and you will walk in my shoes
You wasn't there when I was in deep thought
When I had two choices: kill him, or either leave New York
But I'm a truth teller, that's why I say what I'm saying
And the only thing the radio playing
Is cause you be paying
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beats wit knock no more
So who cares who flop no more?
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And only law dudes can disguise
That your favorite artist (shhh)
I know you hear that (huh?)
You wanna fear that? (what?)
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Icon to rap is like John the Baptist
Prepared the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, having thinking Jesus
Really didn't need us, when He loved the old days
He loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway
Even those who re up for dope, every four days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player gators in Marbres
With me, it's not just bars of music
I walk with God, I got the scars to prove it

[Hook]
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Outro: Mase]
Everybody out there
Just lift your hands right now
Just say this with me
Father, I thank you
For forgiving me of everything I've ever done
For Jesus walking with me
For dying for me
Raising for me
And all my sins have been forgiven
I'm a changed man
I'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich
And it's all because of Him
Now walk with me
Walk with me, walk, walk, walk with me
Walk with me

 

From Snippet

I'm givin' up my slave name
I'm givin' up my slave name
Saint, you don't really need a last name
North, you don't really need a last name
I'm givin' up my slave name
I'm givin' up my slave name

 

[Hook: Kanye West]
My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold
Then I will have the qualm uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh
I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on gon
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black card
I turned around and replied why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Bridge: Kanye West]
La La La La La Off MTV
La La La La La When you gonna go out with Me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Brains Power and Muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle don't know you don't discuss you
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts
There's something I might say There's something I might play
A beat I might made might make they life change
And save they whole deal They wrist is on chill
They house is on hill You could be Lauryn Hill
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on
I'mma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on
Man I'm just sayin
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin
Now y'all just prayin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
You was a vic in high school now you a thug
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice
I'm on point like I speak to dice
Took the underground at a steeper heights
May real niggas see the light got fat girls eating right

[Outro: Kanye West]
Ha ha we in this bitch
It's Common and Kanye y'all niggas know what time it is
Chi-Town motherfuckers DJ Ferris Heavy Hitters what up?
Mike Love What Up? DJ Enuff
Foreal(Pharrell) That's my favorite producer by the way
That's why I had to rap on this Cuz
His tracks is Better Than Yours
My tracks is Better Than Yours
Just Blaze tracks is Better Than Yours
You can have one but we all gonna

I'd like to thank everybody who came out tonight to rock with me. You could have been anywhere in the world. You could have been anywhere in the world...

This is the part of the show where I start complaining about shit, justifying shit, but you know how it is. I'm just happy to be making music and happy to be able to perform this shit for you all. You know with this album, we didn't drop no single for radio; we ain't have no big NBA campaign or nothing like that, we ain't even got no cover. We just made some real music

Back when I used to make albums and shit like a couple years ago, 3 years ago, like 4 years ago, we'd go away and work on an album for like 5 months or something, we'd always have to hold the album til like August or September for the perfect moment or some shit. Because it means that you're probably gonna sell more, get more audience and radio and shit

But, honestly, at this point, when I listen to radio, that ain't where I wanna be no more. And, honestly, at this point, I could give a fuck about selling a million records as long as I can put out an album this summer that you guys can rock to all motherfucking summer. Y'all don't tell me I'm gonna sell more records. Because at this point, I don't really give a fuck about outside opinions. All I give a fuck about is my clique-clique-clique....

 

[Kirk Franklin]
Father
This prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feels they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
Let them know that's why you took the nail
So we could have eternal life
If all God's children would get down on their knees and pray
And give up all of those things that pull our hearts away
You will forgive all of our wrong and make us brand new again
But I won't make it, God, if you let go of my hand
That's why we need more (Faith!)
Yes, I'm searching for you, I'm looking for (More!)
Yes I am, in Your arms is where I feel (Safe!)
They're killing our babies in the streets, I call out for (War!)
I need just a little bit more of some (Faith!)
Just a mustard seed, I'm looking for You for (More!)
Prayer for our homes and our families
We just wanna be (Safe!)
Can't you hear the trumpet sound, I think I hear (War!)

 

[Couplet 1: Kanye West]
Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake, sleep (less in June) or (missing you)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

[Harmonizing]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

[Couplet 2: Kanye West]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool, then lose control

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will

[Verse 3: Kanye West + Caroline Shaw]
I wish this song would really come true
I wish this song would really come true
I wish this song, this song could play and could come true
I wish this song, "Say You Will," would come true
I wish this song
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you
I admit I, don't say, I admit I, don't say I admit I

[Chorus: Kanye West + Caroline Shaw]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I admit I, I admit I
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Say you will, say you will
Don't say I, don't say I
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will

[Instrumental Outro]

 

[Murphy Lee]
Whooooooooooo
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo

[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

[Kanye West {*over the hook*}]
Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like "Nah, I wasn't sleep"
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Torhi, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just like you
I talked to your ex-boyfriend and took a census
But you don't read the cookbook, you just look at the pictures
Matter of fact, when's the last time you looked at the kitchen?
This is gettin' ridiculous, how you gettin' defensive?
Jimmy Choo, Frankie B., bitch you gettin' expensive
I know you fuckin' around, my sixth sense told me
That ain't no male friend that bought you the stereo
She said "He gay anyway, you don't know nothin' about Jamario"

[Hook]

 

[Verse 1]
Everything I do that's not perfect
Only makes it that, that, that much more perfect
Only makes it that, that, that, that much more worth it
Only, only only, only every time when I short-circuit
Everything I do that's not perfect
Only makes it that much, much, much more perfect
Much more perfect, I need it all
I want it all, I need it all, go through it all, climb every wall
Take every fall, break every law, I need it all, I need it all
Go through every wall, take every fall, break every law
Yeah, I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
And I will have it all, and I will have it all, and I will have it all
They ain't laughin' at me, no, no, I laugh at y'all
Nah, I laugh at y'all, no, no, I laugh at y'all
Think you're laughin' at me, no, no, I laugh at y'all
Cause I want it, I want it, I want everything
I want it, everything, I want it all, I want it all, yeah, I want it all
I want it all, all the shit they talk, all the shit they write
All the shit they write, oh, I love it, all the shit they talk
All the shit they write, all that shit to say, you know I love it
Oh, I want it all, I need it all, I need it all
Give it to me right now, I want it all
I'll take it all, take every fall, break every law
Go through every wall, I don't give a fuck, I need it all

 

God! God! God! God! God!

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Welcome to your life
Diamond through the light
This Miami vice
It's that life (okay, okay)
Dodging bullets in the air when (okay, okay)
There's cameras everywhere (okay, okay)
You don't know how to act right
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Travis Scott]
For my theme song (black)
My leather black jeans on (black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm gettin' my scream on
Enter the kingdom (black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gon' come to kill King Kong (skrrrrt, straight up)
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (straight up)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq, bitch

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus & Travis Scott]
Actin' on your worst behavior
Turn your back on all your haters
Everybody wants to rule the
Everybody wants to rule the world (straight up)
The world (straight up)

[Refrain: Kanye West]
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
Everybody
Everybody

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
Everybody wants to rule the world
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
The world, the world, the world
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
The world, the world, the world
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb ,bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action-action
Ready-ready for action

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Refrain: Kanye West]
So follow me up 'cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Interlude: Kanye West & Travis Scott]

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Who can I make that them better right now?
Who, oh I know that'll make it better right now?
Who do I know that'll make 'em better right now?
Who do you know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
If I ever instigated I, I
Tell me who will never related, I

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Annie, are you okay? Ooh, yeah (ooh, la-la)
Annie, are you okay? Ooh, yeah
Do you like foreplay? Ooh, yeah
Do you go both ways? I really need confirmation
Your love is abomination, fucking you is like a bomb of nations
Area 51 in that pussy, ah
The president 'bout to cum in that pussy, ah
I got mind control, I got dick control
I reel 'em in for the fishing pole
I love legs like Robyn Fenty
Stretch them shits like limo Bentleys
Catch them tits with an open mouth
The interview up outta that Oprah house
You know I love it when it's pokin' out
You know I'm thuggin' even in the drought, you know him
I fuck around and crash a brand new Bugatti
In the mothafuckin' lobby so you know I'm in it better
Won't you kiss it, baby? Take a picture
I, I, I, I, I'm killin' em
Illuminati want my money and my body
Even Donny rollin' by me, looking aggravated that I made it
Fuck you and your mama, nigga
I, I, I, I, I see the bitch in them, I got the Benjamin
I got the dividend, I'm on my toes like Serena at the Wimbledon
Pie à la mode on a Monday for my woman-friend
I'm in the mode of a mortal man
I'm living in the orbit of deliverin'
Sex in a cathedral, empty, Grand Marnier that I reload, ten Gs
In the hallway, she a Leo, I'm a Gemini
Give me mine, genocide, kill 'em all, thirty times

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Who can I make that them better right now?
Who, oh I know that'll make it better right now?
Who do I know that'll make 'em better right now?
Who do you know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
If I ever instigated I, I
Tell me who will never related, I

[Outro: Kanye West]
Why I fucked you this evening
At Southside, live for these things
By the way, how you feelin', forgot
I don't give a fuck about your family and that, oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, yeah

 

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Verse 1]
I spent my last eight checks-s-s on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shit
She wanna sip up on the Crissy Cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister in that white Benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon' lie, they only fives but together they ten
And would I do 'em again? Hmmm, hmmm
It's like old folks pissin' 'cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin', just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producin'
The track that got you movin', this track got you movin'
So crazy you don't know what you doin'
You been telling them jokes, and it's not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head 'til it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin down 'fore I pay for this room 'cause

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Verse 2]
Now if you got it, you got it
And if you don't then you probably won't
Sissy nigga call 'em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse 'em
Buy 'em boots just to tell 'em that I Jimmy Choose 'em
Take 'em back to confuse 'em
So she don't know if she comin' or goin'
'Cause mami, after I'm cummin', I'm goin'
Back to the show, just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin', this life is somethin', I know it
And I been known to have a ho or two
'Cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin' you
After that, it's over, boo, baby, grab your coat and voom

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Verse 3]
Now there's three different levels to relationships
Pollyin' at the club with 'em, talkin', gettin' affectionate
Leavin' and havin' sex with 'em, kickin' 'em out
Trickin' on models, dimes and rats
Now I don't get into that, I kick that habit
I just keep 'em impressed, let 'em seat in the Lex
Never eat 'em unless that fuckin' cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'
I got a nine in my pants and baby, I'm just dyin' for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck off the sizzurp?
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She probably look good, but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard and Kanye West]
Yo this is Dirt McGirt
I'm chilling with Kanye West
He's killing y'all niggas on the beats
He's killing y'all niggas on the tracks
Where your plaques at, dog?
The game is officially over
Go kill yourself

[Hook: ODB (K. West)]
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now y'all gon' stop talking that shit that you talking
Your broke-ass mamma couldn't afford that abortion
Now tell me how the hell she gon' afford that coffin
Now I done sat back and seen it all too often
The backbone of this like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the Chi since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My niggas had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it I'm old school
Only difference is my tracks drove niggas postal
So I drove costal while they stay local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you
Sit down I'll coach you while we style in posters, dog
Niggas had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards
Now after all that it took, I made it to The Roc
I guess I ain't as dumb as you look

[Hook: ODB (K. West)]
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now I showed you how to do this, dog
Put a few beats on the tape, I saved this one for myself
I heard you niggas' tapes, need a little bit of help
But I'm rapping and I can't do nothing for you man
Ask G and Hop this, 40 grand if you ain't fam
I mean, if you ain't Hov, if you ain't Cam
Damn I know you say he's killing hisself
He got a little bitty deal now he feeling hisself
Yup just cause I played beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to hospital you
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little you
Who your hype man? I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on The Fast & Furious
Here go a new movie for you critics called "Who's Laughing?"
The first producer that rap better than the rappers

[Hook: ODB (K. West)]
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard and Kanye West]
Aftermath still making them hits, nigga
Lunatics still making them hits, nigga
So So Def still making them hits, nigga
Bad Boy still making them hits, nigga
Wu-Tang still making them hits, nigga
Ruff Ryders still making them hits, nigga
Cash Money still making them hits, nigga
Dirt McGirt still making them hits, nigga
Yo yo the game is over, go kill yourself
Go kill yourself, nigga
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more

 

[Intro: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
Doesn't get much better than that (Nah!)
So unfair, so.. unfair advantage
(Yo, it doesn't feel much better than that)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It's the dream, it's Kobe and Jordan on the same team
In the best prime of their game and the same Kanye
You know the name and it's not pronounced Kane
And every time, you know I spit that flame
Ayo we gettin' out our dreams, gettin' out our dreams
And we gonna buy some things, and we got him out of Queens
Talkin' 'bout my man Consequence, once for the Tribe
Talkin' 'bout my man GLC and now he's around
Talkin' 'bout John Legend, take 'em all the way to Heaven
Speakin' of Heaven, Common speaks the heavenly words
The nouns and verbs and whatever you heard
Whatever synonym, we killin' 'em, everybody feelin' him
The people's choice, the people's champ like Paul Wall
All haters, I gotta say fuck all y'all
No, I won't waste my energy no more
I have to be more concerned about Sierra Leone
I'm talkin' 'bout people that's dyin' for diamonds
And the way that uh
They got uh, capa
What I want to say, monopoly over the country
And every time you say somethin' people act funky
The diamond industry want me, they say I'm bringin' out the bad
What I want, people to stop buyin' diamonds?
No, I want everybody to stop lyin'
They say conflicts is only one percent, and look at all the money rappers spent
We throw the diamonds in the screen, nah mean?
But it affects the families cause people is dyin' for these things
I mean in the diamond rivers they'll mine all day
And might only get paid two cups of rice a day
Is this the price to pay for the icy way?
We like to floss away, even your boy 'Ye
With my Jesus piece, I gave diamonds to my niece
If I had a brother, Kanye, Common made "I Used to Love H.E.R."
Used to love her and I still do, lyrically I kill you
Dog I don't feel you, your style is like mildew
Real old, I'm real cold, listen to this beat, real soul
Your style is real old, dollar bill fold
Stackin' money ain't funny, and I'm out in UK
And I ask 'em who's the best, and they say "you K"
Ooh way ooh way
Yeah I feel it and I gotta kick it off the top of the dome
Microphone controller, that's an M.C., it's in me
I can lead a crowd, I went to your show, it's empty
Go to my shit, it's sold out, every single seat
Every time I drop, because like Shaq, I bring the heat
And anybody that freestyle on the level that I do
Should be winnin' Grammys too
So if you do it like me, you can do it like this
And uh, they say I'm a teacher like the one called Kris
That's KRS but nah it's Kanye West
And every time I spit the rhymes, uh straight off the flesh
I could bring it down to the bone straight from the heart
And from the heart is where I did it 'fore I ever chart
And then I spit it, we get it, we did it, we do it a lot
Kanye spit it, we do it, we makin' it hot
I got patterns like Saturn, the rings, the rings
Uh, Gold Digger, that's the single, the single
Gotta hit the club just to mingle, to mingle
Why you all in my face? I'm tryna do my thing dude
Back off, I'll have Barry smack the fuck out of you
Everybody wanna know what they can get out you
Aww here's my demo, dawg, here's my group
Dawg, please back me up, you're heated up, you're soup
Y'all gassed, I passed, I flow, I rhyme
I'm uh, that's the way, that yah boy gotta shine
Straight from the Chi city, everybody ride with me
And you see the same questions and I gotta teach the lesson
This some, this some sick freestylin', I hear you're readin' it
I gotta keep goin' cause y'all fans, y'all needin' it
Uh, you say I'm too high like I smoke weed in it
And they say "he arrogant, he's always conceited, shit"
Well what you want from me? Y'all just can't stop me
You could look in my pants and tell that I'm cocky

[Bridge 1: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
(Laughing)
(Oh my God, Oh my God)
(Damn) Yeah
We back, we back like we ever left, huh
(Crazy!)
Like we ever left, huh, like we e', like we ever left, huh
Like we ever left, uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Kanye on the Westwood Tour
Chillin' with Westwood
Go to Chicago, that's Kanye West's hood
And the label called G.O.O.D
Should I holla at these bitches? You should
You might need one, you might need one
You might fuck one
If you eat out like McDonald's
I ain't no clown like Ronald
Uh, more like Donald
Trump, with the way I get it crunk
Like my man Lil Jon, but call him Lil Kan'
He all the same, flow like Lil Wayne on Tha Carter
And I'm signed to the Carter faculty
'Cause the Roc is in back of me
Actually, that look like stacks to me
Ch-ching, ch-ching
Yah nahmean, yah nahmean, I'm doin' my thing
Out in U.K., London
And they call me number one
Japan, you're number one
That's Ichiban
And I learned that from KRS-One
Won once again like One
Like Puff, my friend, and One
One, give me one of them
Talkin' 'bout one drink, one hand
One cup of Henny, one cup of Hypno
If you ran out of it, yo, you got to get more
And I might sip slow but I never sip Mo
I sip Cris-o, Cris-y-Cris
And I gotta break it down like Missy Miss
She had the "hee hee, who got the keys?"
You don't need that if you got the no start V
Where you push the button, that ain't nothin'
All y'all talkin' somethin', y'all stay frontin'
Kanye dropped the beats to get 'em jumpin'
Lucifer, top of the morning to yah
Cheerio, hit up the flow, bring it back, oh
From Chicago, uh
And I'm rockin' the Dolce Gabbana
Fashionable persona
GQ, who knew he'd be the flyest?
Like T.W.A.C.W.K
K.A.N.Y W.E.S.T
Be the B.E.S.T

[Bridge 2: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
You know, I'mma stop it right there
(Laughs) I just, I just feel like
I 'on't know if I feel like rappin' right now
(Oh my God!)

I got raps for yah, uh huh
I got raps for yah
I got, uh, I got raps for yah
We goin' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say
Uh, uh
I 'on't know, I 'on't know what
I got so many joints right know, runnin' through my head
I 'on't even know what to yeah
What should, what should I spit?
I could just freestyle off of these messages
Please can you tell
Okay this is a girl writin' this
Please can you tell my uh, boyfriend Danny
That I love him loads, with all my heart
And I can't wait to see him tomorrow

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
She can't wait to see you tomorrow Danny
She love you, mhmm
You know what that mean?
You gonna get some
I wonder if she gon' be wearin' one of those tight outfits
And you know that I like that shit
I ain't sayin' I ever met her but come on
You must be pimpin' and you ain't sweat her, you know?
She writin' you on one of these hip-hop shows
Made me wonder if she's a hip-hop ho
No disrespect, you know
I don't know you so
I will not disrespect, so don't please press eject
On the tape cassette, and don't knock it out of your decks
So with much respect, obliged, when I rhyme
Sometimes some things just pop out, sometimes
I must be a, I forgot the medical name
Not a narcoleptic that be sleepin'
How people was sleepin' when I made it deeper
And I gotta be creepin' cause you know they didn't peep it
Uh, they call me Rockafella's best little secret
Uh, I got the beats for the Jeep
When people used to rock Amigo's and Suzuki's
And the Isuzu's, this the way you flow
Do flow, aye yo you just like Menudo
Played out about mad years ago
And uh, I could rock off the top, I got years of flow
I got so many albums to go, at least about seven
Jesus Walks had me all the way
Thought I was gon' rhyme that, no you didn't time that
Yo that's where the line's at
Look at my shows, look how long that the line's at
All the way to the back, sold out, one night
That's the way it is when you done it right
Take time to drop a album, don't just be buyin' beats from everybody
Cause everybody ain't got it, I got it
I get it, I only give it to those who really live it
Like Jay-Z, the Game, and my dogs that really did it
Like Kweli, like Common, like dudes that really spit it
I'm talkin' 'bout they go onto the radio and hit it
And as far as makin' your songs, it's all wrong
You be doin' everything that everybody else is on
Man, I'mma break it down, let me take it down
Here goes the instructions on how to not say nothin'
Look, you take the crack concept
And you do that 'til it's all dead and gone, you do it all wrong
Now uh, you take the car concept
And I see it every video, every single place I go
Same shit

[Bridge 3: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
Man you know the beat ran out on me
I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna break down
(That was mean, that was mean!) I was gonna break down to people
Exactly how to make the good song and the good album for a change
(Let's go, let's go, let's go!)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
First of all, what you need's a beat from me
If you can't get a beat from me, get a beat from your guy
He'll prolly do it for free
And if he do it like [?] he'll prolly do it for E
And if he do [?], he'll prolly do it for skeet
Yo, yo-yo, yo-yo-yo, you gotta bring with your flow
You gotta take it on-beat and off-beat
And don't rap on no fuckin' soft beats
You know that real hard shit, regardless, I played my part in this
Like, this Corner beat, this what you want when you want a beat
And that's when you really is gonna be
A hip-hop legend like Kan, like Kan
Like, of course the Louis Vuitton, 'ton, don, don
If I do say so, myself
And I do all the time, every rhyme
Cause I'm, I'm feelin' myself
And if you was me, you'd be feelin' yourself, you see
If you out in London, you just hopped on a plane
And you just came out of the bathroom, you just got you some brain
Uh, you doin' your thing
And plus you flossin' that Rocafella chain
Aye yo, you know you let Kan spit on 'em
I'm rockin' the Rocafella chain with no conflicts on 'em
Oh, oh
Now let me bring it back to the flow, flow
And how you make the album and you make some dough, dough
Get you a good manager cause your manager'll fuck your game up
Fuck your name up
And uh, if you've been runnin' to a [?]
Trade your chain for some studio time
See a lot of people be flossin' before they get a chance to
A lot of people want club records they wanna dance to
A lot of people want basslines, they will enhance you
Bass in the club is good too, what you should do
Is prolly get a single like Alicia Keys
And if you don't know her, holla at Alicia please
You know one of 'em light skin bitches with the braids
Actin' like they got it made
[?] you give a dawg with a fade
You get somebody that's weak, you get somebody that you know can't flow
And you rap before him, and let him go
And people gon' be like well least you was better than dude
And [?] I don't mean to be rude
And another thing you can do
If you could channel the spirits like I channel
I'm not talkin' 'bout lightin' candles, I'm not talkin' sayonce
I'm talkin' 'bout talkin' to God, I mean just like once
What I do before I rhyme, every day is I pray
I pray to God that he make these songs in a certain way
I let him speak through me, through the beats, through the music
I mean, sometimes I go into the booth and lose it
I mean, I know he speakin' when I freak it in it a way
That I coulda never thought of somethin' better to say
So, our father, who art up above us
I know any time we fuck, you still love us
Like when I'm cursin' in my verses and I even do, what's worse is
When I'm spendin' too much, spendin' on purses
And shoes for my girl when I should be helpin' the world
Give back to the charity, he still don't embarrass me
He still let me be, He still keep it real
See that's the thing about humans, we got free will
See the angels gotta do exactly what God want 'em to do
God is still with you, even when we don't do
So, follow the path, follow the laws
Follow the reason, the reasons why it's wrong
You never heard a freestyle like this before-'fore
And I know that hip-hop fans want more

[Outro: Kanye West]
Westwood, what's good
Holla at your boy, Kanye the Louis Vuitton Don
The Roca stay, buildin'
Yeah, it's G.O.O.D. Music baby
After you freestyle like that you just talk shit for about eight minutes

 

[Intro: Rihanna + Kanye West]
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

[Verse 1: Kanye West + (Swizz Beatz)]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah we still hood famous

[Hook: Rihanna + Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Good God
Midwest coast back nigga
And don't say nigga unless of course you black nigga
Free country they say that shit in Tennessee
Cuz I got all they white daughters drinking Hennessy
I'ma go to Sal's, put some niggas on a wall
I might go to Oz take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano so involved
I know
King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had 2 polos
We the kids they keep in the back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent, go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They askin' bout the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff

[Bridge: Sister Nancy + Swizz Beatz]
Bam bam, 'ey 'ey 'ey

[Outro: Nina Simone]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

 

[Kanye West]
It’s like I wanna spit something written
But keep forgetting
So I guess it’s from the heart from the start
Played my part
Seemed like I just wasn’t reaching the charts
5000 hours, rewritting Power
Over and over
Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual
So unusual to be in this position
Everything I say everybody tryna diss ‘em
Everybody playin him, truth be told
The last nigga ever let the truth be told
And oh Mos Def ran to my home
And said they gon have yo ass gone
Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks
Can't even take the piss
They gon’ test your urine
Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!
“Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?”
I dont know, ask, ask Hennesy (thats Coca-Cola)
Say ‘he ain't clean enough’
But rappers ain't mean enough?
Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough
On the real, this is like the neo-Emmitt Till
Whistling, get yo fuckin' ass killed
Lets keep this shit real!
Now who the realest
Everybody feel this
And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites
Cause I said what's right
I go to sleep and deal wit it every night
And wake up every morning
And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa whats worser?
Its no verse that would reverse the-
In print or in cursive
They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane
Let's have a ‘toast for the douche bags’
Black people wanna talk about me on blogs
Cause I like clothes like, 'look at this fag'
Thats what I have to deal wit real shit
Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man
A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin’ my part
And all this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't ‘Jesus Walks’
For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears
They playin’ wit niggas careers
Felt like I’m the only real nigga here
From my last breath
They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left
Then they even sent Beyoncé up to give the award back
Didn’t even know I afford that
And she rode the wave as I rode the slave
As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave
Nigga behave, nigga behave
Be the first one
I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin’ and stay frontin’
And get up and just perform, shit is enormous
Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit ’bout
My whole family, now I’m scared of Grammy’s
Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history
So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded
'Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be impor-ted
Uh, it’s too real for these niggas, you feel for these niggas
How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand
Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya

[Mos Def]
No matter what goes on
They may not agree, they may not understand
But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand
And his hand and that hand
And ideas, and all of theres
And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere
So make it clear, live long and prosper
Much success, even if you wish me the opposite
To quote Nas, I stay on my job
Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm
And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me
My life is real even when I’m in the movies
I’m on the ave, I’m in the cave
I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago
My life is real, as it ever been
To all my friends and even foes
Each and every one of those, let em know
I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart
Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position
Feel blessed to make the whole World listen
And just glisten without even trying
Even when I die, I won't stay dead
And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs
Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young
And I’m straight from the slums
And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum…
This thing ups, let us all give some
Number one yo, I’m number none, no comparision
And make the whole world aware of it
Brooklyn in the building we take care of it
Peace out to all the Sagittarius
And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too
And this go out to all area crew
And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me
From the present, and the past and the future and beyond
Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on

 

[Kanye West]
Kanye to the...
Yeah, OK

I'm getting spins all day in L.A
We can go the D where Dwele dwell
D.C, P.G or ATL
Back in the Chi, mean my life like a magazine
Honey wanna know the details about my ebony
Well that's XXL
Far as the penthouse, yeah that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a Black tail
I'm feeling her vibe, her Body and Soul
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Well lets kill all the parlayin and offer you a cosmopolitan
Lets jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends claim I'm a player, you be lucky to keep me
But you know people gon' be talking 'bout us weekly
My car be in a Robb Re-p-o-r-t but what's more important to me
Is that you..

(Dwele)
Open your ears
Don't allow these words to be ignored by years
Fearing lullibies, containing the same old lies (same old lies)
Dealing just to deal is just a crime
Besides I know you wouldn't mind
Trying something new so..

(CHORUS)
Let's (Let's)Try (Try)
We can work it out
If you let love(love) guide (guide)
The way that you feel for me
Oh(Oh) Why(Why)
Let this opportunity pass (pass) by (by)
You should hold on

Please don't resist (don't resist)
Bless those harmonies to me, escape your lips (escape your lips)
There's no need to go home
Just to dance along (dance aloo-o-one)
I know you can't enjoy it on your own
Really I don't see nothing wrong
With you and I spending some time--

Also let me mention, (Oooh)
My only intention, (Oooh)
Is to feed you every single thing you hunger for---
In my heart I have to (Oooh)
And-- want to have you (Oooh)
So fulfilled that you will never need to ask for more--

[Consequence]
Now someone told my girl that she's a trophy wife
Sorta like Grant Hill and Kobe's wife
So when we at a club, and she be so polite
But when we back at home she be poltergeist
I mean provoking fights
Trying to poke me with knifes
And last time I tried to poke her she just told me goodnight
See her clothing be tight
She was pervert approved
So she gave up on life, now she don't wanna move
Hypnotized by the tube
So she stay with the clicker
In a cup full of liquor
Thinkin its makin her thicker
But its makin her slimmer
So our future is dimmer
I can't remember last time I took my baby to dinner
See I'm sayin' a sister who was freaky and ruthless
In a yorkshire terrier in the pocket with pooches
In a pocket with Gucc's
Was taking my lunch money
Just like the gooches
I'll tell you the truth miss

 

[Intro: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Wanna be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself they competition
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Bone girls on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man (uh-huh), no snitchin' man
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen, man
Last 9/11 I was poor on the ave, 'til I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm floorin' the gas
Gotta lotta problems, money's one that I not have no more
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell Biggs that we about to get paid
All my niggas about to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
Goddamn Kanye! (Kanye! Kanye!)
Now hold up... Ain't nobody messin' with me dog
Now you say it ("Ain't nobody messin' with you at all!")
I told dude, "You can't even rap on my interlude"
Now does that make me as rude as Jude?
("When the album comin' out?") Man the peoples is askin'
Yamamoto Adidas is sick with the fashion
Y'all already got dough so just spit for the passion
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks, man
Nope, nope, let's not do that man
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man
And got the whole world shakin' just like crack fiends

[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds
Let the beat ride out for a minute

[Interlude: GLC (Kanye West)]
Let's take it there, take it there man
It's not supposed to be [?]
(GLC where you at homie?)

[Verse 2: GLC]
How many niggas you know that put their life on the line
To get signed? Did a few high crimes, almost had lights out
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count
How could I might doubt? Just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressin'
When I copped them pounds it was my best investments
Dre got shot and that taught me a lesson
For stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses
Last like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Four different blues, man your outfit is clashin'
You ain't got no muscles, you weakling bastard
Man, look at your haircut
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, NAW, your hair sucks
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters?
'87 Go-Getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and yeah
And offers to sell and yell, uh

[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-A-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds

 

Yo, we made this joint, we was like, "We gotta get Preemo to scratch on this shit, seriously." Cause, that's one of my idols, just a legend in the game, a living legend. And then, plus, he, he like porn a lot, so I relate to him with that, you know. And he been to the AVN's, you know. I been to the Grammy's, he been to the AVN's, you know. I'm, and, actu- I'm envious of him, cause Rick Rubin, he actually asked me to go to the AVN's, and I was like, "Man, I can't do it. I just made 'Jesus Walks'. They gon' see me, and they gon' take away my NAACP award." So I was, uh, you know, I have to watch pornos in the privacy of my own home, you know? I really want to go AVN's, but, you know, I can't do it, cause they'll take me off the cover of Jet, and then what? Now I won't make it on the cover of Essence. But one day, one day I'll be there. I'ma have one on of them BAPE hoodies zipped-up with the eyes cut out and some, some gloves with the fingers cut off so I could feel, too, so I could touch. You know they let celebrities touch. That's how it be whenever you go to the strip club, "No touching!  Except for you, 'Ye, you can do whatever you want."

 

[Refrain]
Spit it to you, say little West the little beast
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, peace

[Verse 1]
Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class
So I had to cop the baby mama Benz, Jeep
With put fifty, I get this on the first tape
But that fifty that break the bank
Back when my ATM was crazy slim, had a girl nicknamed Sprewell
'Cause when I try to stop, she still made me spin
Back when '80s was in, my dog Crazy Ken had eighty of them
It's time to hit the dancefloor, you crazy again
And get that cash money like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said, "This car real old," I told her her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club and get a girl that's
Into the fitness, tryna get into the business
I'mma make her my apprentice
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get inside

[Chorus]
Now I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I've been partying with this one girl
Who claim, "I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine"

[Refrain]
Spit it to you, say little West the little beast
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, peace

[Verse 2]
Please, what I gotta win five Grammys
Before you finally let me play Alicia's Keys?
If I can't bone, I'll get a clone
Get her there, got her there, grab her hair
She bobbin', don't stop her there
Told me that she love the Roc so much
She drove all the way to Far Rockaway for Rocawear
More popular, 'cause I abracadabra my Nissan
To a car throwing a peace sign, peace
Damn, that's like the same line I used in the first verse
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wait, it gets worse
I told her S-U-C-K before we F-U-C-K
I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew see K
And if CL like U-C-K, that's how you know chickens C-L-U-C-K
I'm tryna find a crazy female with a cutie face
A big pimper on the DL, like UGK
And then I told her

[Chorus]
I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I've been partying with this one girl
Who claim, "I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine"

 

[Intro: The-Dream + Kanye West]
No one wants to fall out of heaven
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uhh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Fall back in the pussy like swoosh, swoosh, woosh
Ballin' money woos, woos, woos
Y'all niggas got jokes, hot jokes Bruce, Bruce, Bruce
Dog, I'm about to get loose, loose, loose
All night tryna dutty wine
Woke up my dick crooked as the Nike sign
Pop's when you had me on
I could [?] when you had me on

[Hook 1: The-Dream]
No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
She used to get dick from Kanye West
So if you ever see her give her Kanye's best
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
And I just can't seem to get that nigga broke
And I don't know how you get that nigga jokes but
[mumbling]
And if you ever don't than get at me, at me
[mumbling]
We be ballin' like the athletes
The shoes you were wearing were so last week

[Hook 1: The-Dream]
No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven

[Bridge: Bon Iver]
What are we chasing?
It feels like we're changing
(There's no proof)
Those on clouds
Learn to debate YAH
Ain't no love in the playground
(Now I'm speaking truly loud)
Go away!
Chained to the bounce now
Ain't no love in the playground
(Waiting by your phone)
That's a long way

[Hook 2: The-Dream]
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
Nothing that I can do to unbreak your heart
I'm just doing my part
And I try my best not to bring it up
Just look the other way
Used to live in wonder
You were struck and now your love feels like thunder
Thunder
Thunder
Thunder

[Outro: Section 25 sample]
You can see through the veil
And forget all your cares
Throw them
Throw them away

 

Yo what you doing here huh?
(Hi I thought I'd drop by so nice to see you)
Nice to see you too okay
(It's been too long)
Yeah you can leave now

[Verse 1]
Kanye that nigga with heavy dough
Roll dro and a chevy low
Told a long time ago you can't fuck every ho
Whether in Jamaica or Cancun, Mexico
Baby don't be scurred, shake that ass like Mystikal
We got physical now she calling and beeping
Call when I'm sleepin, call my girl claimin we creepin
Bitch you nuts, look I only fucked you once
How you gone get the message, I ain't called you in months
Acting like Super Dave with them dumb ass stunts
Talking bout girls I could get her whatever she want (Whatever I want)
I'm like girls like you be wanted for warrants
Stalking of course, alone on the phone disguising your voice
Got your girls asking for Kay on the three way
Talking bout (You can't call a bitch on her BDay?)
Hmm, Tanisha its over with stop playin
Nah nah it's over. (So what you saying?)
Look you gotta bounce. (I don't wanna fuck with you)
(Get your hands off me!) Bitch I ain't touching you
Stop, Chill. Relax. okay
You know what she told me?

[Hook]
I'm never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go

I'm crazy about you
(No you just crazy)

[Verse 2]
You believe this ho, pop up everywhere I go
Pop up at the show, pop up at the grocery store
Pop up in my kitchen like, "Oh you wash dishes here?"
Pop up in my bathroom, "Oh you take pisses here?"
Listen here we gone need some distance here
(Where I'm gone go?) I don't care, just disappear
You ain't my main bitch not even my main squeeze
Anyway, how the fuck you get a set of keys?
First she used them on my crib, then she used them on my whip
And wrote on the side, "Kanye you ain't shit"
You believe this bitch? Man, did you see this shit!?
Did she just knock my windows out on my Escalade? (Ha yeah nigga!)
That's a twelve fuckin' hundred dollar estimate
She must've took off all yesterday just to hate
Restraining orders ain't stopping her
She the reason caller I.D. so popular
Across the street now with some fuckin binoculars
Screaming at the top of her lungs, "I'm never letting go!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Had enough of the stalker shit got to put her in line
Count back from ten when I got to nine I grabbed mine
Before I gotta do what I gotta do after blue she lying
Like "Nigga you put your hands on me for the last time"
Tried to get you over your uncles to come and jump me
Take my cash and punk me
With my ass and trump me
I stump them fuckin chunkies
Just look at yo niece
She beat her own ass and called the police
(Pregnant with his baby yeah he still getting rough with me!)
And to my crib scuff me up and put the cuffs on me
My momma dropped that five hundo and got me out of custody
Girl left a note on my door (Nigga don't ever fuck with me)
And all the time I got to thinkin that I'm the man
Hottest nigga on the block and shit I got a fan
I'm like a swole nigga thought that he could lift the van
Somebody please come and take this bitch up off my hands!
You don't understand, man

[Hook]

Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, all the same, all the same
All want a nigga with a chain
Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, all the same, all the same
Want a nigga whippin that range
Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, all the same, all the same
Want a nigga banging they brains
Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes

 

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah
It's (a million)

[Hook: Kanye West]
I freestyle battle niggas for (a million)
How many niggas bit the soul? 'Bout (a million)
How many hoes did I bone? 'Bout (a million)
Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's (a million), uh-uh
There's (a million) ways to die, choose one
(A million)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lot of people askin' 'bout the money I made, even Just Blaze
How are they for real, is them niggas really paid?
Rappers I met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match the Neptunes, check
By check if "H to the Izzo" is the only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella shit fold and you move back to the 'Go
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low?
For the millionth time askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me
Like you don't care about my son's feelings?
Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard "Takeover", who running this rap shit?
Ugh, fake tits, shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take 6?
What, you doin' beats in LA for Eminem and Dr. Dre?
Them niggas sold ten mill, I'm trying to get paid
We do this shit for entertainment
Bring guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber
Let one up out the chamber, BLAOW!

[Hook: Kanye West]
How many years did I wait? About (a million)
How many niggas tryin' to hate? About (a million)
But when a nigga count his cake, it's 'bout (a million)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
'04, College Dropout, I make the game different
I don't know what the hell y'all niggas been sniffin'
'Ye still flicking, hoes is my addiction
Five days out the week, you'll find me in the kitchen
Smashing the game, nigga, unlike you
'Cause these beats change the game and the hook's right too
I'm a crook like you
Cats back in the Chi was buying tracks for dirt cheap
Man, what could I do?
Knowing I supposed to style, I'm the fly boy poster child
'Bout to be on Oprah now
It's ironic and whatnot how I put no ice on the Bulgari watch
Just to make it hot
Now you see me on stages, my hit resumes is two pages
For them niggas who played us
Feet just raises, booming like Master Aces
"Stand Up", number one, and there's more to come
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
While y'all brick like Fred, Barney Rubble and them
Chi-Town in this bitch, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thing, nigga, we doing our damn thing, BLAOW!
(A million)

 

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
People keep talking
They can say what they like
I don't worry cause
Everything's gonna be alright
No one but I'm nombre uno
Hey hombre I'm "Ye" so you too low
Money felt like sumo's so haters just gonna sue mo'
What you think gonna happen when they see me in that two do'
She gonna be with you she gonna see me she read' to go
Cause you have re-freshened me I'm fresh head to toe
So let's go let's get let's get it hey
I know you need something different trying to get away
I use that as a segue
Let's hit a spot where they only speak Reggae
Like no one can do it this long
She said "Aye Kan', who you tryin' to be, Akon?"
Sorry the drink had me wildin' a little bit
But my link had me stylin' a little bit
I think I'm gonna hit the island in a bit
But what I said had you smiling didn't it
She laughed at this
But after this
You know I gotta take that off
Young Halle told me "make me feel good"
So I gave her the Monster Balls

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Alicia Keys]
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try
Try to divide
Something so real
So till the end of time
I'm telling you that

[Hook]

 

[Intro]
Yo Hip-Hop, Is niggas still talkin bout I can't rap, come on now

[Verse 1]
Look for me, Young K
Took 2Pac beat and got paid
My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z
Eminem, Mase, Biggie Smalls and me
Now if you was my girlfriend you don't need no guyfriend
He could get his head bust nigga ain't my friend
Why the hell you lying who the hell you trying
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks
When they suggested they was made by Majestic
My Answers cost 350, ya nah'mean?
Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team
You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it
My girl come over try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now bartender two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend

[Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

[Verse 2]
I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles just good times like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room
There's only one bedroom that I call my lair
We was V.I.P
Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend

[Jay-Z] Holla, All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

That's Right (Kanye)

[Jay-Z] All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
Look for me
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend
[Jay-Z] Yep!

[Intro: Nina Simone]
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 1: Kanye West & (Young Thug)]
For my southside niggas that know me best
I feel like Taylor Swift still owe me sex
Why I made that bitch famous (Swea)
I made that bitch famous (I made her famous)
For my Chitown niggas that know me best
I feel like Amber Rose still owe me sex (Chiraq)
Why? I made that bitch famous
Not really, but somewhat famous (err, kinda)
All I do is get tattoos and read French Vague
Every bitch in the spot wanna drink my Ragu

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Who am I to remind you? (What?)
But tell me, who am I to remind you? (Who am I?)
And did you know that the country, Switzerland
It was famous for lakes?
And I think I got my ring from there 'cause it's icy like skates
Nigga, icy like hockey
Cold like a dead body, yeah

[Chorus: Nina Simone + Young Thug]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start (Oh yeah)
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 3: Kanye West + Young Thug]
Nike slave, fit in your place
Don't come out your face
Don't come out your mouth
Don't come out your house
Don't come out the blah
It came out the North, it came out the South
The tally is down
Bumpin' the...
The hate is anony...
The Copacabana...
It made me...
Someone told me...
The world turnin' Black slowly
Where you can call niggas "niggas"
But you better not mention Hitler
So tell me who run the label, where the guns from? Us
Tell me now, where we get the guns from? Us
Tell me now, where we get the guns from? Us
US!

[Chorus: Nina Simone + Young Thug]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Free like a bird
I just wanted you to know
Know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
One more time for the Chi-Town
One more time for the A-Town
I bet that money come around if you stay down
I swear, I just came from Europe, my money colored like a clown
Nigga play with keys, Swizz Beatz
Nigga only fuck unique freaks
Still Michael Jackson after all these leaks (what?)
Yeah, bitch, you're still Dirty Diana to me (woo!)
Pop a hundred bottles, I'm the shot caller (ballin'!)
Came up out a hot boy, fuck a baller blocker
Bitches makin' lots of noise like Griselda Blanco
You hit it first and bought a purse and she moved off your blocka' (fool!)
Lick the molly off my hand
Smokin' loud, ambulance
And I was high as hell, I need to come down
Somebody call Tar, I need a Xan
Eat that pussy like a jelly bean
My patna's bigger than a jelly bean
Got a mink on like I'm Hakeem
Got fish filet but we don't fry these
Gold card with a Trojan
Rub the bitch with the lotion
Bitch I'm ballin' like Kobe
Bitch I'm ballin' like LeBron
No, no, we don't broadcast
Pussy nigga gotta show
Monkey nigga actin' like they don't know me
But a lot of monkey niggas owe me

[Chorus: Nina Simone + Young Thug]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

 

[Intro 2x]
Runaway, did I make you runaway? Did I make you runaway?
How many people came with the one they love tonight?

[Verse 1]
You know love ain't always gon' be easy
Especially when people in your business like the way they do Yeezy
And ladies? I know you girls gon' be
Always talk 'bout what he did
Fellas? I know you guys
Always talk 'bout what she did
Y'all be going through up's and down's
Havin' fights and shit
I want you do a favor
First of all, just for the ladies
I just want you do me more favor
And y'all please now checking e-mails, cause I
Got it in the e-mails so guys get away with shit and some
I'm just serious, I'm just serious, I'm just serious
But for real 'bout tonight

[Hook 2x]
If you love someone tonight hold onto'em real tight
If you love somebody tonight hold onto'em real tight, real tight, real tight

[Verse 2]
Cause I always find, yeah I always find
If I told you I can make ... tonight
Don't listen to me baby cause I'm an asshole
And you always find, and you always find
Yeah I always find, yeah I always find
If I told you I can make the way to heaven tonight
Don't listen to me baby cause I'm an asshole
And you always find, yeah you always find
Yeah I always find, yeah I always find
If I told you I won every single bill 'bout you every minute I had to
Don't listen to me cause I'm an asshole
And you always found and the one place I fucked up
I thought you'd always be mine, I thought you'd always be mine
I thought you'd always be mine and if I say I didn't love you, I was lying
I swear to God I was lying, I swear to God I was lying
I swear to God I was lying, I swear to God I was lying

[Bridge]
So do me a favor

[Hook 2x]
If you love someone tonight hold onto'em real tight
If you love somebody tonight hold onto'em real tight, real tight, real tight

 

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh

[Refrain]
Hopped off the Amistad and made "I'm A God"
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
See, I say what they say when the mic is off

[Verse 1]
Parents are the strippers, strip kids of they confidence
Teach white dominance, question your common sense
See, I've been washed in tradition and I'ma rinse

[Refrain]
Hopped off the Amistad and made "I'm A God"
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
See, I say what they say when the mic is off

 

I don't know if y'all know this one thing about me, but I ain't no motherfucking celebrity. I don't know if y'all know this one thing about me, but I'm a terrible, terrible, terrible celebrity. I don't know if you know this one thing about me, but I'm the worst kind, the worst kind, the worst kind of celebrity. Because all I do is make real music. All I do is sit in the studio and make real, real shit. And that's it. That's motherfucking it, that's motherfucking it

So I don't want nobody coming up to me with no cameras trying to like, sell pictures and shit to magazines. Asking me no dumbass questions. Throwing me off of my focus and shit. Harassing you all mothafucking day. I ain't no motherfucking celebrity. No, no, no, no it's not me. It's too much goddamn you. Lower, lower. Octave under

Y'all take the pianos an octave down. Yo, take away the "ha, ha, ha." No "ha, ha, ha." Take that shit

It's so funny, somebody asked me "when you do SNL, are you going to do like a skit about the paparazzi and shit and like humanize yourself?" I ain't here to apologize to no motherfuckers, man. It ain't about me humanizing myself. At what point did I become so inhuman where I had to turn myself back? Or maybe I was demonized, maybe I was treated inhumane in that type of situation. I ain't a fucking celebrity. I ain't running for office. I ain't kissing nobody's motherfucking babies--I drop your baby and then you sue me and shit

I'm trying to make some music that inspires people to be the best they can be -- And I don't want nobody to ask nothing else of me! Don't ask nothing else of me. Motherfuckers chasing you down about to make you crash into shit, and all they want you to make is a nigga to laugh and shit. Hell no I ain't doing no 'SNL' skits, this is my goddamn life, and this ain't no motherfucking joke. That's it, stop that shit

 

[Intro: Kanye West]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got 'em, Young Carter
On the A-team if it's in alphabetical order
Used to daydream about Benzes and Porches
And by 18, I had a Benz and a Porsche, ha!
I'm so used to stuntin' on y'all
So tired of ballin', excuse me if I yawn
Ha! But I know what I'm doing
Out the window of the jet, you see L.A. like a Bruin, ha
New coupe, foot to the floor
Weather man make it rain, turn sugar to snow, you know
Ha! But watch how you speak
Cause in the street you can't trust every smile you meet, heh
And you ain’t important as the new edition is
Ralph Tresvant, ooh, they so sensitive
And it's the remix, baby!
And I'm a knock it out like Felix, baby, haha
God damn I'm fly
And my troop so cool, I don't have to lie
Hop in my car and go Kanye West
With my groovy new Louis Vuitton Damier vest
Ha! Yeah, let 'em hate though
I'm on my way to the bank, LMAO (wassup?)

[Hook: Kanye West]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
It's one of the best to touch microphones
That'll spit the kind of shit to put the earth in a type of zone, like
To make 'em laugh or make 'em cry
Bring a life into existence or cause you to die
Now when I was a shorty and when my mom called me precious
I realized I'm outspoken and every word was infectious
I'm sayin', Mommy said God'll bless us
No matter the difficulties or how much it would stress us
I'm sayin', no matter how hard I try
To understand if I behave that I'll see God when I die, man
These words'll dawn on me, why?
Cause no one came back from death to say if it's truth or it's lies
See the point that I'm makin' is that she knew I was blessed
And comin' to life as a legend, the man of best in the flesh
I kiss my mother, countin' figures
Thinkin 'back on when I used to tell niggas, they sayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yeah, homie this a theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always pray to have gleam on
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Learjet
Fly as the insect, even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number
Cause when I get my money right she gon' come running
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "O"
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional
And my chain so fresh, they go (oh oh oh oh oh)
Right after the fame did you gain anything?
Damn Ye, would you change anything?
But (If I had a billion dollars)
I'd cop more pink polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
“Wait 'til  get my money,” everybody motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything I wrote
Yeah, hey mama they can't hate him
Cause after all of the drama, K slayed 'em

[Hook]

 

How y'all feelin' tonight? Thank y'all for coming out to this impromptu type important performance, let me just say that right quick. I love the energy in this city - this is one of my all-time towns y'all know I stay out here. But I came here for the creativity more than anything, because creativity fuels everything

I hate business people. People get on the phone with me and tell me ya know like, 'What kind of business can you do, though? What type of business are you doing? What's the numbers? How much did you sell? What's the radio spins? How much shampoo can you sell with your face on it and shit?

Remind me again why we in this shit
Can you remind me again why we in this shit?

Remind me again why we in this shit (3x)
I know it's for more than to just get rich
Since when was making music about getting rich?
Since when was making art about getting rich?
And I know it's easy for me to say cause
Having money's not anything and not having it is

Remind me again why we in this shit
Remind me again why the Grammys couldn't suck my dick

Remind me again who's the original Superfly -
And I got love for Hov but I ain't fuckin' with that "Suit and Tie."

Remind me again
Remind me again why we in this shit -
Every nigga tryin' get rich
Every rapper tryin' get rich
And every rapper rap about fuckin' somebody else... bitch

Remind me why we in this shit -
And why the Grammys can suck my dick, suck my big, black dick

And every motherfuckin' sponsor, shit
They try to put their logos all over the concerts and shit
For a meet-and-greet, and you gotta meet the execs and their daughter
And they'll show you what they just bought her

Remind again why we in this shit -
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit. (x5)
They say either you comin' on too strong in this shit -
They always talkin' 'bout what I'm doing wrong in this shit
Well I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING, DICK
I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING DICK!
Remind me why we in this shit -
I lost my motherfuckin' mama
So I could give a fuck about your comments
I promise
Cause we all gonna die one day
BUT I'MMA LIVE MY LIFE MY WAY!

Remind me why we in this shit? Please? can I sell a drink for you please?
So you can help me put on a better show, Please? Corporations?
Can you please support me? I swear I'm a nice nigga now. I swear I'll put the pink polo back on. I swear to you. Please. Just for three million dollars. I need it so bad. I need a new pool in my back yard. So I tell all my fans that your shit is cool. And if they believe in me they should also believe in you. Did you get the check yet? I have to call a business manager - did the corporations send the check yet? What's my public rating right now? Are people liking me again? Enough to get money from the corporations - is it OK now? They forgot about the whole Beyonce thing right? Okay cool. Is it OK now?

Remind me why we in this shit -

Nigga I'mma make my music from my heart, and I live and I die by
Everything that I say and everything that I do
And everything that I make is what I believe to be true
And if that shit don't make sense and sound like nonsense
I don't give a fuck - cause that was my stream of conscience
And that's the way I felt at that time
And feelings was the only facts
And Racism and materialism is killing blacks
And one more thing, if I can ask -
One more thing if I can ask -
Cause in this life our life just moves too fast
And time is something you will never get back
What's your quality of life?
What's your quality of life?
And that's why I mean it when I say I hope you have a good time tonight
I hope you have a good time tonight...

LONDON! It's Louise Wilson's birthday tonight - an inspiration, not the lead instrument I'm the lead instrument. Happy birthday to Louise who taught Alexander McQueen... and Kanye West, even though she doesn't want me to put that on my resume. But I just feel sometimes like there is no good ideas and no real ideas and nothing sincere left. And everything's been so homogenized. And it's all Big Business, and there's no creativity. When really we have the ability to have a union Utopia if we just help each other, if we just use our resources and stop trying to compete against each other and
Beat each other and
Eat each other
And maybe come together and try to teach each other and
Reach each other and
Maybe try to come together and love each other
Love each other and
Love one another, man
The way you love your mother, man
The way you should love her, man

Y'already understand
Cause this is our shit
And this is our clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique
I said ain't nobody fresher than MY MOTHERFUCKIN' CLIQUE!

 

[Freestyle 1: Kanye West] (To Nick Cannon)
Ayo dog
Nicky my dog
And this is for sure
So I'm not going to break you down
Ask Christina Millian know what we did on tour
Stays on tour, and i'll tell you right now
And I like Indian girls, but I won't hurry
Last time we boned, you had the bedroom smelling like curry

[Freestyle 2: Kanye West] (To Kat Williams)
Come on boss
You were suppose to be the Pimp and Prince
I've seen you in Friday after next
And I haven't seen you since

[Freestyle 3: Kanye West]
Look it's hard for me to say shit
Cause I don't know about that gay shit
But I see you do, looking like Tiger Woods
Like lost in the hood
Looking like Bryant Gumbel
And expect me to be humble
Every time I flip a fold your goin to crumble
With them phony ass pony's
Bitch read the news
Why you always try running in the back and grab all the free shoes
So Why don't you buy somethin' ?
Why don't you try somethin' ?
Stop lying, stop fronting
Y'all niggas don't know about nothing

[Freestyle 4: Kanye West]
I could rip all of yall
In a line
With every rhyme
Yall know Kanye, is like the greatest all time
'Cause I do the Grammys, and comeback with my family
Rippin' you muthafuckers
With the mic that you hand me
You all don't understand me dawg
You still pushing camrys
Please, step back for a minute
You the Lieutenant, I'm the General
And generality killing yall
And Yeah, and I could keep it right there
Kanye ripping you niggas
This shit is unfair!

 

[Verse]
Sitting on a runway, time on my hands, thinking of you again
As I replay our conversations, pray that everything fell in place
Like a mirror lookin' back at me, sayin' you're the only one
Makin' me feel I could survive, so glad to be alive
Nowhere to run, I got a song to sing
Messed up inside and it's been raining all day

[Chorus]
Since you went away, Southside serenade
Since you went away, Southside serenade

[Bridge]
South-south-southside, southside
South-southside, southside
South-southside

[Chorus]
Since you went away, Southside serenade
Since you went away, Southside serenade
South-south-southside

 

[Intro: Fats Gonder]
So now ladies and gentlemen this is star time
Are you ready for star time?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Life of the rich and gorgeous
Someone gonna be forging it
I told my dad I would have been aborted
If I wasn't the one that put the cord in
Pulling up in something looking foreign
Remember when a nigga couldn't afford shit
Now I get the order
Thumbing thumbing through my wallet
Automatic toilet, now that's the shit
Popping off with the orbit, I got ya bitch
Let it go

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
God dammit I need you now
God damn
Don't you play no

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let me fix my neck, chain on
Let me fix the check, games on
Let me thump a thump game on
And ain't nobody playing with him no
Summertime rain with him no
They all layin' with him now
So I got the Marvin Williams with him now
No one wanna pray with him no
Want it done bathe in it now
Wanna get a raise with him now
Something down in nah-ney with em now
Like we always
Talk to me like we always
The illuminati
Dirt Bike or a Kawasaki
Bottle up on a new party

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
God dammit I need you now
God dammit
Don't you play with you

[Verse 3: Kanye West]

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
God dammit I need you now
God dammit
Don't you play with you

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
With your praying hands
For you lil' niggas I'm way advanced
And I don't write rhymes, I write tattoos
And when I die they build statues
You niggas ain't got the cashews
From the city where cash rules
Till they run up on a bad mood
Bitch that's a bad move
Bitch get out the way
Someone gonna get out today
And I know I was gone for a minute
But need to get out today
Now let us get this money
Sell it for [?] if I want to

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
God dammit I need you now
God dammit
Don't you play with you

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
Don't play boy
Someone [?] what you made boy
Hoppin in the mansion
Waking around with a robe on
I could have started play boy
Cause I married a playmate
[?]
When you stay eight
And they rate
[?]
I kinda want the nudes
Something for when I'm in that mood
Woo

 

It's Kanye West straight outta Chi-Town
Super producer brought you joints like
H to the Izzo, Takeover and that new Scarface single
And I'm chillin with the leader of the new school
Absolute heavy hitters y'all

[Intro]
Yo...
I'm Kanye To The, first of all coming straight from the Chi
Uh, I don't lie
It's like the singer say
I've been known to do beats like that, know what I'm saying
Brought you hits such as
Uh, Uh
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Gimme some brain before I hop up on this plane
Gotta head right back to the Chi

[Verse 1]
Now even though I went to college and dropped outta school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time only
Two way or phone me, if you tryna bone me
Yo man got money, you still feel lonely
Claim he love you, it's no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony
You a light skinneded Nia, dark skinneded Tamia
Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia
It be going in and out that's why I barely hear ya
It be going in and out like a robberia
I'm tryna take this money like Rob and G-Dep
And I'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams
And my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream
And it gets so bad she wanna tear up my things
But still

[Hook]
K-A-N-Y-E, Chi-Town playa out in NYC
She said she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans cuz the ass is free

[Verse 2]
I love girls, girls, I got a fetish for em
But not no lettuce for em
Dick and bad credit for em
Bills, bills, I know she tryna get paid
She know I'm tryna get laid
She figure that's an even trade off
If she a stewardess I show her to my cockpit
If she a lawyer then I give her Johnnie Cochran
If she wanna see me again
She better get 2 friends then maybe then
We'll have group sex, toothex
And a young girl off that X
And she just turned eight-teen
Last week she was against the law
So for her birthday I put this dick against her jaw
And like a picture in a frame put it against the wall
Said she had never been with a man before
But she not a virgin, huh, she a lady lover
I didn't know y'all take each other out and date each other
But that's a lady lover
I ain't even know that was ya baby mother

[Hook]

[Outro]
Explain the outro man, don't nobody never get to the outro
I just take a whole record and just
I'm not gonna talk about the producer shit right now
I just want niggas to realize my shit, you know what I'm saying
2002, aight
I sounded real mad on the last mixtape
I'm not even gonna go there this time, ok

 

[Intro]
Yo, it's Kanye To The
I did this beat in '96 and ah...

[Verse]
Is it the because my beats the nicest
Got me chargin' niggas Dr. Evil prices
Niggas will sell their soul to go platinum and gold
I'm cold cause I got the gold and kept my soul
Drop an album full of soul, sold twelve times gold
That's six plat, man that's a sick plaque
Man don't forget that at the top is where you feel the loneliness
Like grabbin' fake titties, I swear I feel the phoniest
Cause I'm from a city where you never know who your homies is
Cause everybody wants your spot, No I.D. told me this
Oh I seen homies get shiesty on me quick
Woooooo, just imagine if I only spit?
But I do beats too, that's the American dream
Stack to make sure my shorties inherit some things
A couple real estate investments, got niggas sayin'
"There's the Kennedys!" But oh yes it's, the Wests
Brand new Roc-A-Fella most fresh to death is
Definitely Kanye, peace to Sportie LA
That keep my shoe game early like the grave shift
Plus keep my closet cooped up like a slave ship
How you gon' look at me and say I ain't made shit?
Just look at my outfit, I got all the basics
Air Force, check, Rolex, check
Call Gee and Hop, did you get the check?
Roc-a-Fella piece, check, don't forget the neck
Is it the money on deck that keeps on the honeys on the dick?
Now that ain't really rhyme but I ain't really tryin'
Last 9/11 I was poor on the ave till I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm floorin' the gas
Got a lot of problems, money's one that I not have
Date ballplayers' wives, that divorce and got half
Shit, I figure they deserve somethin' for all them hours
And that be the realest shit I never wrote
Only book I ever read I could have wrote, 48 Laws Of Power
Me, Gee and Hop, uh huh, the game's ours
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain than my real one
Cause on the real son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuckin' smoke
If you paid, then she's thinkin' bout her children, feel him?
Prolly not though, unless you got dough, you know what I mean?
You will think the grass greener when you finally get green
I told Regina, you ain't been in a Medina
Yeah, I seen you grabbin' on my balls like Serena
Yeah, y'all the invisible ho, you ain't never seen her
Mhm, she must stay around your grandma's crib
Right next door to where the in-laws live
I brought a man from the fifth floor all in y'all crib

[Outro]
Remember niggas back at school
They didn't have no girl at school
So they be like, "I got a girl, she just stay by my grandma's crib." Hahaha
Yo, Dame, where the fuck you find me? Hahaha

 

When I'm far away from you my baby
I know it's hard for you my baby
Because it's hard for me my baby
And the darkest hour is just before dawn
Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
And the darkest hour is just before dawn
Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I love
Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love

 

Don't talk
I appreciate it
I appreciate 'at
But don't talk
You
I know
I don't want

That's fine
But don't talk
To me
I don't want to hear paparazzi talk to me
Or anybody I know
It doesn't [matter]
No no
But don't talk
To me
At all
And don't talk to anyone I know
At all
And tell everybody never talk
To anyone
That anyone knows.
Don't talk to themselves
Don't talk ever again

Yo, I said don't
I said don't talk!

 

[Intro: Woman (Kanye West)]
(First of all, this song right here got...)
You say what is it that you want?
(...a long ass intro)
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
(you got everything)
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(You got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(What else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it, I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (Know what?) and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian
And ain't never seen him and MCM
Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil' Kim (Yes I would)
We gon' roll this weed
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
I'm doin' beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone
Now she like a lot of clothes, I like to see her out of 'em
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
Don't give Kanye a chance
'Cause I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and "Do she need that beat tracked again?"

[Hook: Kanye West]
'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe
Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ
The way she looked on Chyna Doll, I woulda did them beats for free
'Cause only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D-Dot was t-teasin' me
I bought some earrings like, "Baby, that may be fake"
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'
Now maybe Kay can get a ménage with Lazy K
And Lady May, maybe, hey?
You're lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a nigga that can give you dick and beats
So go and get Angie and tell her

[Hook: Kanye West]
'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

[Outro: Kanye]
Got a two for head sale
Send, send headshots first though
Will you beat tapes for who? Oh, Trina?
Oh, I'm right there, I'm right there
I'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes
Yo yo, she said she want her ass look gushy wet
I told her all I need is my back end check
I told her to—
I ain't finish that verse

 

[Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right For The Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

[Verse 1]
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...
I came..

[Hook]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) 4x
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Verse 2]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS..

[Lil Jon]
STOP! IT'S THA MUTHAFUCKIN' REMIX!!

[Beat changes to Lil Jon's version]

[Verse 3: Fonzworth Bentley]
B-E-N-T-L-E-Y
Yee ain't know, you betta ask somebody
What we gonna do is twirk that body
All day, every day fitness party
Lock them doors, don't tell nobody
Gentlemens in the Gentlemen's Club
And hitting them with an interesting dub
It's upside down that's for the A-Town
What y'all sayin'?
F.J. Bentley caught misbehaving
Yes I'm the captain and I'm saving, all my money
Yes I'm just gonna stand and watch you dance from over here
Matter fact pass the Couvorsier
But I will walk you to your car my dear
Cheers

[Hook]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) 4x
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Interlude: Ladies speaking w/ Kanye in the background]

Broke ass no mo'

(I appreciate your time)
I want to see you work out for me
Woah yeah

 

Yo it's the Lake Shore Drive
Keep it live, tight, raw
You better hurry up, they can't keep it in the store
To be the format, your whole style on one beat
Insert the disk, watch a nigga press delete
Tryna flex your technique
You gettin' blasted with a TEC, that shit is mad ironic
Like Alanis Morisette, you try but can't jet
Bunch of airline lyrics, rhymes for low fare
Flyin' out of O'Hare
While these no-name ass niggas wanna go there, nobodies
Livin' three blocks from nowhere, down the street from nothin'
Let me show these niggas somethin', visual aid, the page
And the nigga who fronted, word to God, they don't want it
But they wanna play the role, actin' hardcore
Watch the whole career, flow, my style is too cold
Always, forever like Luther, but it ain't original
Because I stole it from the future, now I'm wanted in three centuries
The verbal killin', ask me where I got the style
Told 'em from my grandchildren, put it on files
Document it in the books
You niggas can't see me so cease the hard looks
I'll rather it get took
Live and die for rhymes, dedicated to hip-hop
Shit don't stop
Niggas they wanna know what and who's next
And you roll up in a Lex
That's the train stop, my brain drop mad lyrics
I rhyme with the spirit off the top, I drop nonstop
Verbally killin', my style is ready to willin'
Y'all niggas stay back chillin'
Like EPMD y'all niggas ain't seein' me, what
We're enormous, nah, do or die
I got the rhymes on the brain
They tried to bomb me on the plane so I rode the train
Before I got here, spawned here
I'm 'bout to save this shit, yo it's my year, what!?
Bring it on, pass it to my man Tariq
Rock the mic all week

 

How many of you people came here with someone you love tonight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. Hold on, hold on. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on, hold on. Hold on tonight

Tonight I was thinking about being as safe as possible, I don't want to say nothing politically incorrect. [???] A very safe musician. I've been thinking about it. I've been thinking about going backstage and not saying nothing at all, is that cool? Uhh, before I go back there I got to ask you one question. Just one real quick. Just one. CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? It's like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause I've been putting up with they shit just way too long. I'm so gifted at finding what they don't like the most. So if they find that they don't like the most

You know, it's so interesting cause they're trying to make me, like you just read the, Don't me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. [?]. It's the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, it's funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know it's like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didn't understand, like they just didn't understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud?

I had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs. I had a dream that I was Walt Disney. I had a dream that I was The Wright Brothers. I had a dream that I was Thomas Edison. I had a dream that I was Mandela. I had a dream that I was Martin Luther King. I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream. I had a dream, I had a dream. And I'm not afraid to dream out loud. You know you just get so scared that people are gonna think you're crazy, or that you're stupid, or that you're foolish, or this is the time that everybody thinks you're losing your mind, but I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind! I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm not losing, I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what I'm saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me. And if what I'm saying offends you, and makes you feel like the worst you, than that's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true

Cause there's only two types of people, there's dreamers and there's haters. There's dreamers and there's haters. And all I've been doing recently is cutting the grass real low. So if you a dreamer, everybody will know. And if you a hater, make yourself be seen, CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU, THATS WHAT I MEAN! Cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low. [?] I find [?], cause I feel like I just try sometimes. And I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid at all. THEY CAN'T STAND ME! THEY CAN'T CONTROL ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!!! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!

I ain't saying, when I say you I'm talking about public perception, I'm talking about backlash, I'm talking about all the tools they use to hold dreamers back, to make them look like motherfucking lunatics. How many people you know, that you talk to on a day to day basis, that made a motherfucking mountain open up in Tampa tonight? So all the other shit I'm talking about, is it crazy or is it possible? Put your hands up if you think anything is possible. Put your hands up if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible. Cause God made us in his image. And God made us all artists as children, God made us all artists as children. And somehow that peer pressure takes the artist out of you. Somehow the world can leave you so [?] confused, and you forget who you are. But I'm remembering, I'm remembering, I'm remembering

Cause most people, you know they say, they say people in my position, what ever that position is, like a celebrity or you make money, you have some type of status or some shit, you don't wanna fuck it up right? You don't wanna ruin your name, you don't wanna say anything wrong. So what you do is you get on TV you just smile, you just wave, and you try to be as safe as possible, cause you don't wanna fuck up enough, BUT I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP!!! I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP! I WANNA FUCK UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 'CAUSE I'm STILL BEATING! As long as my heart is beating, as long as I'm dreaming. And I'mma stay kicking and dreaming, kicking and screaming, kicking and dreaming

I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. And I stand here, the Gemini that I am, and there are so many examples throughout our history: Miles Davis, Biggie Smalls, Lauryn Hill, Prince, 2Pac. The Gemini that I am, it is my responsibility to turn up and tell you the truth. And if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, and if I, if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, the rest of the time, what the fuck were they telling you? If I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, what the FUCK were they telling you?!? What the fuck are they telling you? So don't let nobody kill your dreams, don't let nobody tell you what you can do. Cause the more you accomplish, the more they wanna say you look like a fool. Following what you want to tonight, and you gotta an opportunity in the world

How many people are under 20 tonight? How many people are under 30 tonight? Under 40, under 50, under 60, GOD DAMMIT YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ARE LIVING, YOU ARE BREATHING, SO [??] YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THIS WORLD!!!
